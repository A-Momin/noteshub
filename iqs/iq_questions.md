    - AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. You can upload your code, and Lambda automatically takes care of scaling, monitoring, and maintaining the compute fleet needed to run your code.

2. <b style="color:magenta">How does AWS Lambda differ from traditional server-based computing?</b>

    - In traditional server-based computing, you need to provision and manage servers to host your application, and you pay for those servers whether they are actively processing requests or not. With AWS Lambda, you don't need to manage servers. The service automatically scales to handle the number of incoming requests and charges you only for the compute time consumed.

3. <b style="color:magenta">What are the key components of AWS Lambda?</b>

    - The key components of AWS Lambda include:

        - `Function`: The piece of code you want to run.
        - `Event Source`: AWS service or developer-created application that produces events to trigger a Lambda function.
        - `Execution Role`: The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that grants permissions to your Lambda function.

4. <b style="color:magenta">How does AWS Lambda pricing work? </b>

    - AWS Lambda pricing is based on the number of requests for your functions and the time your code executes. You are charged based on the number of requests and the duration your code runs in 100ms increments. There are no charges when your code is not running.

5. <b style="color:magenta">How does AWS Lambda work?</b>

    - AWS Lambda runs code in response to events, such as changes to data in an S3 bucket or updates to a DynamoDB table. It automatically scales your application by running code in parallel.

13. <b style="color:magenta">What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous invocation in AWS Lambda?</b>

    - Synchronous invocation waits for the function to process the event and returns a response. Asynchronous invocation queues the event for processing and returns immediately.

14. <b style="color:magenta">How can you troubleshoot and monitor AWS Lambda functions?</b>

    - AWS provides tools such as CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Metrics, and AWS X-Ray for troubleshooting and monitoring Lambda functions.

15. <b style="color:magenta">What is the cold start problem in AWS Lambda?</b>

1.  <b style="color:magenta">What is AWS API Gateway? </b>

    -   AWS API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. It acts as a gateway for APIs, providing features such as request and response transformations, authentication and authorization, traffic management, monitoring, and more.

1.  <b style="color:magenta">Explain the main components of AWS API Gateway. </b>

    -   The main components of AWS API Gateway include:

        -   `API`: Represents a collection of resources and methods.
        -   `Resource`: Represents an entity in your API, such as a service or product.
        -   `Method`: Represents a verb applied to a resource, such as GET or POST.
        -   `Integration`: Connects the API to backend services or Lambda functions.
        -   `Deployment`: A snapshot of your API that is made publicly available.

1.  <b style="color:magenta">What is the difference between REST and WebSocket APIs in AWS API Gateway? </b>
    -   `REST API`: Used for traditional request-response communication. Clients make requests, and the API returns responses.
    -   `WebSocket API`: Used for real-time communication. It enables full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection.
1.  <b style="color:magenta">How can you secure an API Gateway endpoint? </b>

    -   AWS API Gateway provides various mechanisms for securing endpoints, including:

        -   `API Key`: A simple way to control access to your API.
        -   `IAM Roles and Policies`: Grant AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles the necessary permissions.
        -   `Lambda Authorizers`: Use a Lambda function to control access.
        -   `Cognito User Pools`: Integrate with Amazon Cognito for user authentication.

1.  <b style="color:magenta">Explain the purpose of API Gateway stages. </b>

    -   API Gateway stages are used to deploy APIs to different environments, such as development, testing, and production. Each stage is a named reference to a deployment, and it allows you to manage and control access to different versions of your API.

1.  <b style="color:magenta">What is CORS, and how does API Gateway handle it? </b>

    -   CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers that allows or restricts web applications running at one origin to access resources from a different origin. API Gateway can handle CORS by enabling CORS support for the API and specifying the allowed origins, headers, and methods.

1.  <b style="color:magenta">How can you implement caching in API Gateway? </b>

    -   Caching in API Gateway can be implemented by creating a cache in a specific stage of your API. You can configure the cache settings, including the cache capacity and time-to-live (TTL) for cached data. This helps improve the performance of your API by reducing the need to invoke the backend for frequently requested data.

1.  <b style="color:magenta">What is the purpose of API Gateway usage plans? </b>

    -   API Gateway usage plans allow you to set up throttling and quota limits for your API. This helps you control how your clients can access your APIs and manage their usage. Usage plans are useful for monetizing APIs, controlling access, and preventing abuse.

1.  <b style="color:magenta">Explain the difference between HTTP and REST APIs in API Gateway. </b>
    -   `HTTP API`: A cost-effective option for high-performance applications that require low-latency communication. It is designed for API proxying and does not support all the features of REST APIs.
    -   `REST API`: Provides a more feature-rich set, supporting a wider range of configurations, integrations, and customization options.
1.  <b style="color:magenta">How can you deploy an API Gateway using AWS CloudFormation? </b>
    -   You can deploy an API Gateway using AWS CloudFormation by defining the API Gateway resources in a CloudFormation template. This template specifies the API definition, including endpoints, methods, integrations, authorizers, and other configurations. Once the template is defined, you can use CloudFormation to create and manage the API Gateway stack.
