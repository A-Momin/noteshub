#### Architecture and Components:

4. **Explain the architecture of AWS Glue.**

AWS Glue’s architecture is designed to support scalable ETL operations in a serverless environment:

-   **Data Sources**: AWS Glue integrates with multiple data sources, such as Amazon S3, DynamoDB, RDS, and other external databases.
-   **Glue Crawlers**: These automatically discover and classify data, updating the Glue Data Catalog with metadata information.
-   **Glue Jobs**: These are scripts that perform the actual ETL operations. The scripts can be automatically generated by Glue or written by the user.
-   **Triggers and Workflows**: These define the sequence and scheduling of Glue jobs.
-   **Development Endpoints**: These provide an interactive environment for writing and debugging ETL code.
-   **AWS Glue Data Catalog**: Central metadata store for organizing and managing data.

5. **What is a Glue Crawler, and how does it function?**

A Glue Crawler is a service that automatically discovers data stored in different repositories (such as S3, DynamoDB, etc.) and populates the Glue Data Catalog with metadata.

-   Crawlers connect to your data stores (S3, Redshift, etc.) and inspect the data to infer its schema (e.g., columns, data types, partition keys).
-   After discovering the data, the crawler updates the Glue Data Catalog with metadata.
-   Crawlers can run on a schedule or be triggered manually.
-   They support multiple data formats like JSON, Parquet, ORC, and CSV.

1. **What are AWS Glue jobs, and how are they executed?**

AWS Glue jobs are scripts that define the ETL process for transforming and moving data between sources and targets.

-   Jobs can be written in PySpark (Python with Apache Spark) or Scala, and Python Shell jobs.
-   The jobs can be executed on-demand, based on triggers, or scheduled using the AWS Glue console or SDK.
-   Glue automatically provisions the necessary infrastructure to execute the job in a fully managed, serverless environment.
-   Job logs and metrics are available in Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring.

1. **Describe the types of jobs available in AWS Glue (ETL, Python Shell, etc.).**

-   **ETL Jobs**: These are used to transform and move data from sources to targets using PySpark (Python-based Spark) or Scala. They typically interact with data lakes (S3) and data warehouses (Redshift).
-   **Python Shell Jobs**: These are lightweight jobs that run Python scripts (without Spark) for simpler data manipulations. They're useful for non-distributed tasks like API calls, data formatting, or lightweight transformations.
-   **Streaming Jobs**: AWS Glue supports real-time data processing with Spark Streaming, allowing for the continuous processing of streaming data.
-   **Machine Learning Transforms**: Glue provides ML-based jobs for data deduplication and matching, like FindMatches.

8. **How does AWS Glue integrate with other AWS services like Amazon S3, Redshift, and Athena?**

AWS Glue integrates seamlessly with other AWS services to create a cohesive data pipeline:

-   **Amazon S3**: AWS Glue can read from and write to Amazon S3, making it ideal for transforming and moving data within data lakes.
-   **Amazon Redshift**: Glue can load transformed data directly into Redshift, enabling data warehousing for analytics.
-   **Amazon Athena**: Glue Data Catalog integrates with Athena, allowing users to query data in S3 using SQL. Athena relies on the Glue Data Catalog for metadata definitions.
-   **AWS Lambda**: AWS Glue jobs can be triggered using Lambda functions for more complex workflows or event-based data processing.
-   **Amazon RDS**: Glue can pull data from Amazon RDS databases (such as PostgreSQL or MySQL) and perform ETL operations before writing the results to other destinations like S3 or Redshift.

#### ETL Processes:

9. **What is an ETL job in AWS Glue, and how do you create one?**
   An ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) job in AWS Glue is a script that extracts data from a source, transforms it, and loads it into a target data store. ETL jobs in AWS Glue are commonly written in PySpark or Scala.

-   `Define Data Source`: Identify the data source from which you want to extract data (e.g., Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Redshift).
-   `Create or Use a Crawler`: Run a Glue crawler to catalog your source data's schema, or manually define the schema in the Glue Data Catalog.
-   `Generate or Write ETL Code`: Glue can automatically generate a script based on the source and target schema. Alternatively, you can write a custom script in Python or Scala.
-   `Define the Target`: Specify where the transformed data should be written (e.g., Amazon S3, Redshift).
-   `Configure Job`: Set up the job’s configuration such as instance type, number of workers, and any necessary parameters.
-   `Execute Job`: Run the job either on-demand or using triggers and workflows for automation.
-   `Monitor and Debug`: Check logs and metrics in Amazon CloudWatch for performance and debugging.

1. **How do you handle schema evolution in AWS Glue ETL jobs?**
   Schema evolution occurs when the structure of the data changes over time. AWS Glue handles this through:

-   **Glue Crawlers**: Automatically detect schema changes and update the Glue Data Catalog with new or modified schema definitions.
-   **Table Versioning**: AWS Glue Data Catalog supports versioning for tables, allowing you to keep track of different schema versions.
-   **Glue ETL Job Configurations**: Jobs can be configured to handle evolving schemas, such as ignoring new columns or using a specific schema version.
-   **Apache Spark's Support for Schema Evolution**: PySpark allows you to handle nullable fields, optional columns, and other schema-related changes flexibly during data transformations.

11. **Explain the process of transforming data using AWS Glue.**
    AWS Glue simplifies data transformation using its ETL jobs, and the typical process involves:
1. **Extract Data**: Glue reads data from sources such as S3, RDS, or DynamoDB using a DataFrame API in PySpark or Scala.
1. **Apply Transformations**: You can clean, filter, map, and join datasets. Common operations include:
    - Data type conversions.
    - Handling missing or null values.
    - Aggregation or deduplication.
    - Changing data structure (e.g., flattening nested data).
      Glue provides a built-in library of transformations or allows you to create custom Python or Scala transformations.
1. **Load Transformed Data**: After transformations, data is written to the target, such as an Amazon S3 bucket (as Parquet, ORC, etc.), Redshift tables, or other databases.

#### Data Catalog:

12. **How do you create and manage tables in the AWS Glue Data Catalog?**
    AWS Glue Data Catalog tables store metadata about the actual datasets stored in different data stores.

-   `Create via Glue Crawlers`: A Glue crawler can automatically detect and catalog data from sources like S3. The crawler creates tables and partitions in the Glue Data Catalog based on the dataset's schema.
-   `Manual Creation`: You can manually create tables in the Glue console by defining the schema (e.g., column names, types, and data location).
-   `Updating Tables`: When the underlying dataset changes (e.g., new columns, partitions), rerun the crawler or manually update the schema.
-   `Partitioning`: Tables can have partition keys defined (e.g., date or region) to improve query performance.
-   `Table Management`: You can manage permissions, schema versions, and data lineage in the Glue Data Catalog through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.

1. **What is the purpose of classifiers in AWS Glue, and how do they work?**
   Classifiers in AWS Glue help determine the format and schema of data during the crawling process. Classifiers identify and infer the structure of data stored in various formats, like CSV, JSON, Parquet, or custom formats.

-   **Built-in Classifiers**: Glue comes with pre-built classifiers for common file formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet, etc.). These classifiers examine data and assign the appropriate schema.
-   **Custom Classifiers**: You can define your own classifiers using Grok patterns, JSONPath, or XML tags for more complex data formats.
-   **Execution Process**: When a Glue crawler runs, it uses the classifiers to inspect the data. If it matches a known format, the classifier assigns the schema and adds it to the Data Catalog.
-   **Prioritization**: If multiple classifiers are used in a crawler, Glue will prioritize based on their order and use the first matching classifier.

1.  **How do you manage versioning of schemas in the AWS Glue Data Catalog?**
    AWS Glue Data Catalog supports schema versioning to handle changes in data structure over time. This allows users to track and access different schema versions for the same dataset.

    -   `Automatic Versioning`: Every time the schema of a table is updated, Glue automatically creates a new version in the Data Catalog.
    -   `Viewing Versions`: You can view and manage different schema versions via the Glue console or programmatically through the AWS SDK.
    -   `Rollback`: If a new schema version introduces problems, you can revert to a previous version of the schema without altering the underlying data.
    -   `Partition-level Schema Versioning`: Glue supports schema versioning even at the partition level, allowing different partitions of the same table to have different schema versions.

2.  **How do you use the AWS Glue Data Catalog with Amazon Athena?**
    Amazon Athena is a serverless query service that allows you to analyze data in S3 using SQL. Athena relies on the Glue Data Catalog for table definitions and metadata.

    -   `Catalog Data:` First, run Glue Crawlers to discover datasets stored in S3 and populate the Glue Data Catalog with the schema.
    -   `Query Data in S3:` Once the schema is in the Glue Data Catalog, you can query the data using Athena. Athena queries the metadata stored in the Glue Data Catalog and retrieves data directly from S3.
    -   `Manage Partitions:` Glue Crawlers can update partitions in the Data Catalog, which improves the performance of Athena queries.
    -   `Permissions:` Ensure that the IAM roles for Glue and Athena have the correct permissions to access the Data Catalog.
    -   `Schema Updates:` As the Glue Data Catalog evolves, Athena will automatically reflect the changes, allowing users to query updated schemas without any additional steps.

<details><summary style="font-size:20px;color:red;text-align:left">Lambda Questions</summary>

1. <details><summary style="font-size:18px;color:#C71585">What is code signing in AWS Lambda?</summary>

    **Code signing** in AWS Lambda is a security feature that helps ensure only trusted code is deployed to your Lambda functions. It allows you to digitally sign your Lambda deployment packages, verifying their integrity and authenticity before they can be deployed. Code signing ensures that only code signed by trusted sources reaches production, adding an extra layer of security.

    ### Key Components of Code Signing in AWS Lambda

    1. **Code Signing Configurations**: You create a code signing configuration that includes settings for:
        - **Allowed Publishers**: Specifies the AWS Signer signing profile(s) trusted for signing the code.
        - **Validation Policies**: Specifies the integrity checks performed on the code (e.g., whether to warn or fail on validation errors).
    2. **AWS Signer**: This is an AWS service that you use to sign your code. You create a **signing profile** in AWS Signer, which defines the signing configuration, including the private key used for signing and the allowed validation policies.

    3. **Digital Signatures**: Code signing uses a cryptographic signature created by AWS Signer, which is attached to the deployment package and verified by Lambda. This signature certifies that the code has not been altered since it was signed.

    4. **Enforcement of Code Signing**: When a code signing configuration is attached to a Lambda function, Lambda enforces that only signed code (matching the trusted signing profile and passing the integrity checks) can be deployed. Unsigned or tampered code will be rejected, and Lambda will return an error during deployment.

    ### Benefits of Code Signing

    - **Enhanced Security**: Verifies that only code from trusted sources is deployed, reducing the risk of deploying unauthorized code.
    - **Code Integrity**: Ensures that the code package hasn’t been modified since it was signed.
    - **Compliance**: Helps meet compliance requirements by providing a documented audit trail of code authenticity checks.

    ### Code Signing Process

    1. **Sign the Code**: The deployment package is signed with a digital signature using AWS Signer.
    2. **Deploy the Signed Code**: When deploying the function, Lambda checks the signature against the allowed publishers and applies the validation policies defined in the code signing configuration.
    3. **Validation**: If the signature matches the allowed profile and passes integrity checks, the code is deployed. Otherwise, Lambda will return an error, preventing the deployment.

    ### Example Use Case

    For example, if you work in a security-sensitive environment, such as financial services, you might enforce code signing on Lambda functions to ensure only code from specific developers or CI/CD systems is deployed. This way, you’re protected from unauthorized or accidentally modified code reaching production.

    ### How to Enable Code Signing

    In AWS, you can enable code signing by:

    4. Creating a signing profile in AWS Signer.
    5. Creating a code signing configuration in Lambda with the allowed signing profile.
    6. Attaching the code signing configuration to your Lambda function.

    With code signing, you maintain tighter control over the integrity and origin of your Lambda functions, bolstering your application's security.

    </details>

2. <details><summary style="font-size:18px;color:#C71585">What is Function URL in AWS Lambda? What is it used for?</summary>

    In AWS Lambda, a **Function URL** is a dedicated HTTPS endpoint that allows you to directly invoke a Lambda function over HTTP without needing an intermediary, like an API Gateway. This feature enables you to call Lambda functions through a unique URL, making it easier and faster to expose Lambda functions as lightweight HTTP endpoints for simple, low-latency applications.

    #### Key Features of Lambda Function URLs:

    7. **HTTPS Endpoint**: Each Function URL is a unique HTTPS URL that routes requests directly to the Lambda function.
    8. **Authentication Options**: You can secure Function URLs by allowing only authenticated AWS IAM users to invoke the function, or you can allow public access if you don’t need authentication.
    9. **CORS Support**: Function URLs support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to control which origins can access the endpoint, making it useful for web applications needing cross-origin access.
    10. **Simpler than API Gateway**: Unlike API Gateway, Function URLs don’t provide routing, throttling, or complex configurations, making them a lightweight and cost-effective option for simple scenarios.

    #### Use Cases for Lambda Function URLs

    11. **Public API Endpoints**: Function URLs are ideal for building simple RESTful APIs that do not require API Gateway’s full set of features (e.g., for handling low-volume traffic or internal tools).
    12. **Prototyping and Testing**: Function URLs provide an easy way to test and prototype Lambda functions with direct HTTP access, bypassing additional layers.
    13. **Webhooks and Event Triggers**: You can use Function URLs for webhook integrations where external systems need to call a Lambda function directly.
    14. **Internal Tools or Low-Complexity Applications**: For simple applications, Function URLs offer a more cost-effective and easier-to-manage solution than configuring API Gateway.

    #### Example of Using Lambda Function URLs

    To create a Function URL, you can use the AWS Console, CLI, or SDK. Here’s a basic CLI example:

    ```bash
    aws lambda create-function-url-config \
    --function-name MyFunction \
    --auth-type NONE \
    --cors AllowCredentials=true,AllowMethods=POST,AllowOrigins=*
    ```

    In this example:

    - `auth-type NONE` allows unauthenticated access.
    - `cors` is set to allow all origins and POST requests, which could be adjusted based on your needs.

    Function URLs simplify the process of exposing Lambda functions over HTTP and serve as a convenient solution for simple, HTTP-triggered tasks without needing a full API management layer like API Gateway.

    </details>

3. <details><summary style="font-size:18px;color:#C71585">Explain versioning of AWS Lambda</summary>

    In AWS Lambda, a **version** is a specific, immutable snapshot of your Lambda function's code and configuration at a given point in time. When you publish a version of a Lambda function, AWS saves the state of the function, including the code, environment variables, and other settings, making it distinct from the `$LATEST` version, which is the most recent unpublished version.

    #### Key Concepts

    1. **Versions**:

    - Each version is identified by a unique numerical value (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.) and cannot be changed once published. This immutability ensures that your function behaves consistently whenever that version is invoked.

    1. **Aliases**:

    - Aliases are pointers to specific versions of your Lambda function. You can use aliases to simplify function management, allowing you to refer to a version by a name (e.g., `production`, `staging`) rather than a version number.

    #### Benefits of Using Versions

    1. **Stable Releases**:

    - By publishing versions, you can create stable releases of your Lambda function that won’t change unexpectedly. This is particularly important for production environments where you want consistent behavior.

    1. **Rollback Capability**:

    - If a new version of your function introduces a bug, you can easily roll back to a previous version without modifying your deployment process.

    1. **Testing and Staging**:

    - You can create different versions for testing and staging purposes. This allows you to validate changes in a controlled environment before promoting them to production.

    1. **Version Control**:

    - Versions provide a way to manage changes over time, enabling better tracking of function evolution and the ability to audit changes.

    1. **Controlled Traffic Distribution**:

    - Using aliases, you can distribute traffic between different versions of a function (e.g., blue-green deployments or canary releases) to test new features with a subset of users before a full rollout.

    #### Example Workflow

    1. **Develop and Test**:

    - You develop your Lambda function and test it using the `$LATEST` version.

    1. **Publish a Version**:

    - Once you're satisfied with the changes, you publish a version. For example, you might publish version `1` of your function.

    1. **Create an Alias**:

    - You create an alias called `production` that points to version `1`.

    1. **Deploy Updates**:

    - You make further changes and publish version `2`. You can test it without affecting production by referencing it directly.

    1. **Update the Alias**:

    - After testing version `2`, if it works as expected, you can update the `production` alias to point to version `2`.

    1. **Rollback if Necessary**:

    - If version `2` causes issues, you can quickly change the alias back to point to version `1`.

    Concurrency in the context of AWS Lambda refers to the ability of your Lambda functions to handle multiple requests simultaneously. Understanding concurrency is crucial for optimizing performance and resource usage in serverless applications.

    #### Key Concepts

    1. **Concurrency**:

    - This is the number of requests that your Lambda function can process at the same time. Each request that is processed by a Lambda function runs in a separate execution environment, which is an isolated instance.

    1. **Execution Environment**:

    - When a Lambda function is invoked, AWS provisions an execution environment to handle the request. This environment includes the necessary runtime and dependencies for your code.

    1. **Cold Start vs. Warm Start**:

    - **Cold Start**: This occurs when a Lambda function is invoked for the first time after being idle or when scaling up. AWS needs to provision a new execution environment, which can introduce latency.
    - **Warm Start**: If an execution environment is already running (from a previous invocation), subsequent invocations can reuse that environment, resulting in lower latency.

    #### Types of Concurrency

    1. **Total Concurrency**:

    - This is the maximum number of concurrent executions across all Lambda functions in your account within a specific AWS Region. AWS sets a default limit (e.g., 1,000 concurrent executions), which can be increased upon request.

    1. **Reserved Concurrency**:

    - You can allocate a specific number of concurrent executions to a particular function by setting a reserved concurrency limit. This guarantees that the specified number of instances are always available for that function, protecting it from being throttled by other functions using the account's concurrency.

    1. **Unreserved Concurrency**:

    - This is the remaining capacity available after reserved concurrency has been accounted for. Functions without reserved concurrency can utilize this unreserved portion.

    #### Throttling

    When the number of concurrent executions exceeds the limit (either total or reserved), additional requests will be throttled. Throttled requests receive an error response (HTTP 429) and can be retried depending on the triggering event.

    #### Monitoring Concurrency

    AWS provides tools like **CloudWatch** to monitor Lambda concurrency metrics. You can track:

    - **Concurrent Executions**: The number of Lambda instances currently running.
    - **Throttles**: The number of requests that were throttled due to exceeding concurrency limits.
    - **Invocations**: The number of times your function is invoked.

    #### Best Practices

    1. **Set Reserved Concurrency**: If you have critical functions that must maintain performance, set reserved concurrency to ensure they are not affected by traffic to other functions.

    2. **Monitor and Adjust**: Use CloudWatch to monitor your functions' performance and adjust concurrency settings as necessary to meet changing demands.

    3. **Optimize Cold Starts**: Minimize the impact of cold starts by optimizing your function code and dependencies, and consider using provisioned concurrency for critical functions.

    #### Summary

    Concurrency in AWS Lambda is a fundamental concept that affects how well your serverless applications perform under load. By understanding and managing concurrency, you can optimize the responsiveness and reliability of your Lambda functions, ensuring they can handle varying workloads efficiently.

5. <b style="color:magenta">What is AWS Lambda?</b>

    - AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. You can upload your code, and Lambda automatically takes care of scaling, monitoring, and maintaining the compute fleet needed to run your code.

6. <b style="color:magenta">How does AWS Lambda differ from traditional server-based computing?</b>

    - In traditional server-based computing, you need to provision and manage servers to host your application, and you pay for those servers whether they are actively processing requests or not. With AWS Lambda, you don't need to manage servers. The service automatically scales to handle the number of incoming requests and charges you only for the compute time consumed.

7. <b style="color:magenta">What are the key components of AWS Lambda?</b>

    - The key components of AWS Lambda include:

        - `Function`: The piece of code you want to run.
        - `Event Source`: AWS service or developer-created application that produces events to trigger a Lambda function.
        - `Execution Role`: The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that grants permissions to your Lambda function.

8. <b style="color:magenta">How does AWS Lambda pricing work? </b>

    - AWS Lambda pricing is based on the number of requests for your functions and the time your code executes. You are charged based on the number of requests and the duration your code runs in 100ms increments. There are no charges when your code is not running.

9. <b style="color:magenta">How does AWS Lambda work?</b>

    - AWS Lambda runs code in response to events, such as changes to data in an S3 bucket or updates to a DynamoDB table. It automatically scales your application by running code in parallel.

10. <b style="color:magenta">What is the Handler in AWS Lambda?</b>

    - The handler is the method in your Lambda function that processes events. It takes input from the event parameter and produces output. The handler is defined as <filename>.<function> in the Lambda configuration.

11. <b style="color:magenta">Which programming languages are supported by AWS Lambda?</b>

    - AWS Lambda supports multiple languages, including Python, Node.js, Java, C#, Go, and Ruby.

12. <b style="color:magenta">What is the maximum execution time for a single AWS Lambda function invocation?</b>

13. <b style="color:magenta">What is the maximum size of a deployment package for an AWS Lambda function?</b>

    - the maximum size of a deployment package for an AWS Lambda function is 250 MB when uploading your deployment package directly through the AWS Management Console. If you are using AWS CLI or an SDK, the maximum size is 50 MB.
    - the maximum size for a deployment package (ZIP archive) when deploying an AWS Lambda function from an Amazon S3 bucket is 3 GB. This applies when you package your Lambda function code and dependencies into a ZIP file and upload it to an S3 bucket. The Lambda function code can then be deployed directly from the S3 bucket.

14. <b style="color:magenta">What is AWS Lambda Layers?</b>

    - AWS Lambda Layers allow you to centrally manage code and data that is shared across multiple functions. Layers can be used to include libraries, custom runtimes, and other dependencies.

15. <b style="color:magenta">Can AWS Lambda functions access the internet?</b>

    - Yes, Lambda functions can access the internet if they are configured to run in a VPC with a NAT gateway or if the function is not in a VPC.

16. <b style="color:magenta">What is AWS Lambda Execution Role?</b>

    - The AWS Lambda Execution Role is an IAM role that grants permissions to AWS Lambda to access other AWS resources during function execution, such as reading from S3 or writing to DynamoDB.

17. <b style="color:magenta">What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous invocation in AWS Lambda?</b>

    - Synchronous invocation waits for the function to process the event and returns a response. Asynchronous invocation queues the event for processing and returns immediately.

18. <b style="color:magenta">How can you troubleshoot and monitor AWS Lambda functions?</b>

    - AWS provides tools such as CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Metrics, and AWS X-Ray for troubleshooting and monitoring Lambda functions.

19. <b style="color:magenta">What is the cold start problem in AWS Lambda?</b>

    - The cold start problem refers to the initial latency experienced when a Lambda function is invoked for the first time or after being idle. It is due to the time required to allocate resources for the function.

20. <b style="color:magenta">How can you secure sensitive information in Lambda functions?</b>

    - Sensitive information can be stored in environment variables, encrypted using AWS Key Management Service (KMS), or by using secure storage solutions.

21. <b style="color:magenta">What is the purpose of the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) in AWS Lambda?</b>

    - The Dead Letter Queue is used to capture events for failed asynchronous invocations, allowing for further analysis and troubleshooting.

22. <b style="color:magenta">Can Lambda functions run in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)?</b>

    - Yes, Lambda functions can run inside a VPC, allowing them to access resources within the VPC, but it requires proper configuration.

23. <b style="color:magenta">What is AWS Lambda Destinations?</b>

    - AWS Lambda Destinations allow you to send the output of a Lambda function to another AWS service directly, simplifying the integration with downstream processes.

24. <b style="color:magenta">How can you version and publish Lambda functions?</b>

    - Lambda functions can be versioned, and different versions can be published as aliases, allowing for safe updates and rollbacks without changing the function's ARN.

25. <b style="color:magenta">What is the maximum number of concurrent executions for a Lambda function by default?</b>

    - By default, a Lambda function has a limit of 1000 concurrent executions. This limit can be increased by contacting AWS support.

26. <b style="color:magenta">What is the purpose of the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)?</b>

    - AWS SAM is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. It extends AWS CloudFormation to provide a simplified way of defining serverless resources.

27. <b style="color:magenta">How can you optimize the performance of AWS Lambda functions?</b>

    - Performance optimization can be achieved by using provisioned concurrency, optimizing code, and minimizing dependencies for faster cold starts.

28. <b style="color:magenta">Can Lambda functions be triggered by CloudWatch Events?</b>

    - Yes, CloudWatch Events can trigger Lambda functions based on scheduled events or changes in AWS resources, providing a powerful automation mechanism.

29. <b style="color:magenta">What is the difference between AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate?</b>
