-   [Load Balancers for System Design Interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chyZRNT7eEo)

A **Load Balancer** is a critical component in modern IT infrastructure that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal resource utilization, high availability, and reliability of applications. It acts as a single point of contact for clients, improving the overall performance of an application by efficiently managing traffic loads.

#### Key Functions of a Load Balancer

1. `Traffic Distribution`:

    - Distributes incoming requests to multiple backend servers (also called targets or instances).
    - Prevents any single server from becoming overwhelmed with too much traffic.

2. `Failover and High Availability`:

    - Monitors the health of servers in the backend pool.
    - Automatically reroutes traffic to healthy servers if one or more servers fail, ensuring uninterrupted service.

3. `Scalability`:

    - Supports scaling applications by adding or removing servers without downtime.
    - Handles sudden traffic spikes effectively by spreading the load.

4. `Performance Optimization`:

    - Balances traffic based on specific algorithms (e.g., round-robin, least connections, etc.).
    - Ensures efficient use of resources by distributing workloads evenly.

5. `Security`:
    - Protects backend servers by hiding their IP addresses and acting as a proxy.
    - Integrates with firewalls, SSL/TLS encryption, and other security mechanisms to secure data transmission.

#### Types of Load Balancers

1.  **Based on Layer of Operation:**

    a. `Layer 4 Load Balancer (Transport Layer)`:

    -   Operates at the OSI model's Layer 4 (TCP/UDP protocols).
    -   Balances traffic based on IP address, TCP port, or UDP port.
    -   Lightweight and fast but lacks application-level insight.
    -   Example: AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB).

    b. `Layer 7 Load Balancer (Application Layer)`:

    -   Operates at the OSI model's Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS protocols).
    -   Balances traffic based on application-specific data such as URL, cookies, headers, or HTTP methods.
    -   Supports advanced routing features and content-based routing.
    -   Example: AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB).

2.  **Based on Deployment:**
    a. `Hardware Load Balancers`:

    -   Physical devices used in on-premises data centers.
    -   High performance but expensive and less flexible.
    -   Examples: F5 Networks, Citrix ADC.

    b. `Software Load Balancers`:

    -   Software applications installed on virtual machines or servers.
    -   Cost-effective and highly configurable.
    -   Examples: HAProxy, NGINX.

    c. `Cloud Load Balancers`:

    -   Fully managed services provided by cloud providers.
    -   Scalable, reliable, and easy to integrate with cloud environments.
    -   Examples: AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), Google Cloud Load Balancer, Azure Load Balancer.

#### Load Balancing Algorithms

Load Balancers use algorithms to determine how traffic is distributed across servers. Common algorithms include:

1. `Round Robin`

    - Distributes requests sequentially across servers in a circular order.
    - Simple and effective for equally capable servers.

2. `Least Connections`

    - Sends traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
    - Ideal for servers with varying capacities or workloads.

3. `Weighted Round Robin`

    - Assigns a weight to each server based on its capacity, distributing traffic proportionally.

4. `IP Hashing`

    - Routes traffic based on a hash of the clientâ€™s IP address.
    - Ensures that a client is consistently directed to the same server.

5. `Random`

    - Randomly assigns traffic to servers.
    - Suitable for simple and low-traffic environments.

6. `Content-Based Routing`
    - Routes traffic based on content type, such as URL paths, headers, or cookies.
    - Commonly used in Layer 7 load balancers.

#### Health Checks

Load Balancers periodically perform health checks to ensure backend servers are available and capable of handling traffic. Types of health checks:

-   `Ping Check`: Verifies if the server is reachable.
-   `TCP Check`: Ensures that the server can establish a TCP connection.
-   `HTTP/HTTPS Check`: Confirms that the server responds with a valid HTTP status code.

#### Benefits of Load Balancers

1. `Improved Application Availability`: Prevents downtime by redistributing traffic when servers fail.
2. `Enhanced Performance`: Ensures even workload distribution, reducing latency and improving response times.
3. `Scalability`: Supports scaling horizontally by adding more servers as traffic increases.
4. `Fault Tolerance`: Automatically reroutes traffic to healthy servers during outages.
5. `Better Resource Utilization`: Ensures optimal use of server resources, avoiding under- or over-utilization.
6. `Simplified Maintenance`: Allows individual servers to go offline for updates without disrupting services.

#### Common Use Cases

1. `Web Applications`: Balances traffic among web servers for high availability and performance.
2. `API Gateways`: Distributes API requests to backend microservices.
3. `E-Commerce`: Handles sudden spikes during sales or promotions.
4. `Video Streaming`: Balances video content delivery among multiple media servers.

#### Load Balancer in Cloud Environments

Cloud providers offer managed load balancers with advanced features:

-   `AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)`: Includes Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, and Gateway Load Balancer.
-   `Azure Load Balancer`: Includes Standard Load Balancer and Application Gateway.
-   `Google Cloud Load Balancer`: Offers global HTTP(S) and TCP/UDP load balancing.

#### Load Balancer vs Reverse Proxy

While both distribute traffic to backend servers:

-   `Load Balancer`: Primarily focuses on distributing traffic for scalability and reliability.
-   `Reverse Proxy`: Acts as an intermediary for security, caching, and traffic optimization, often working with a load balancer.
