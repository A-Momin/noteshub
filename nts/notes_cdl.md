A combination vehicle is a type of commercial vehicle that consists of two or more units coupled together. Typically, this involves a tractor unit (also known as a truck or cab) and one or more trailers or semi-trailers. These vehicles are commonly used for transporting goods over long distances and are essential in the logistics and freight industry.

#### Key Characteristics of Combination Vehicles:

1. **Tractor Unit**: The powered vehicle that provides the engine and driving capabilities. It usually has a coupling device to connect to a trailer.
2. **Trailer/Semi-Trailer**: The non-powered unit(s) that carry the cargo. A semi-trailer lacks a front axle and is designed to be attached and supported by the tractor unit.

3. **Coupling Device**: This is the mechanism that connects the tractor unit to the trailer, allowing for safe and efficient transportation. Common coupling devices include fifth wheels for semi-trailers and hitches for full trailers.

#### Types of Combination Vehicles:

1. **Semi-Trailer Combination**:
    - **Tractor-Semi-Trailer**: The most common type, where the tractor unit is coupled with a single semi-trailer. The semi-trailer is supported at the front by the tractor and at the rear by its own wheels.
2. **Full Trailer Combination**:
    - **Tractor-Full Trailer**: In this setup, the tractor pulls a full trailer that has front and rear axles. Full trailers are connected to the tractor via a drawbar.
3. **Double or Triple Trailer Combinations**:
    - **Truck and Double Trailers**: Also known as "doubles," where a tractor pulls two semi-trailers connected by a converter dolly.
    - **Truck and Triple Trailers**: Similar to doubles but with three semi-trailers. These are often called "triples" and are subject to more stringent regulations due to their length and complexity.

#### Semi-Truck

A semi-truck, also known as a semi, tractor-trailer, big rig, or 18-wheeler, is a combination vehicle used primarily for transporting freight. It consists of a tractor unit and one or more trailers. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

-   **Components of a Semi-Truck**:

    -   **Tractor Unit (Cab or Truck)**

        -   `Engine and Powertrain`: Provides the necessary power to pull the trailer. These engines are typically large and designed for heavy-duty use.
        -   `Cab`: The driver's compartment, which may include a sleeper area for long-haul trips.
        -   `Fifth Wheel Coupling`: A circular coupling device that connects to the trailer, allowing it to pivot while being towed.

    -   **Trailer (Semi-Trailer)**

        -   `Cargo Area`: The section where goods are stored. It may be enclosed (dry van), refrigerated (reefer), open (flatbed), or specialized for specific types of cargo (e.g., tanker).
        -   `Rear Axles`: Support the trailer and allow it to move. Unlike a full trailer, a semi-trailer does not have front axles.
