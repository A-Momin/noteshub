##### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

-   IaC is a methodology where infrastructure is defined and managed using code, allowing for versioning, automation, and consistency.
-   Terraform is a popular cloud agnostic IaC tool used to provision, version, and manage infrastructure in a declarative manner.

##### Terraform Configuration

-   A set of files written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) that describe the desired infrastructure state.
-   The main configuration file is usually named `main.tf` and contains resource definitions, providers, variables, and other settings.

##### Provider

-   Providers are responsible for interacting with APIs and exposing resources for a specific infrastructure platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
-   Providers are declared in the configuration file to specify the target platform and set configuration details.

    ```ini
    provider "aws" {
        region = "us-west-2"
    }
    ```

##### Resource

-   A representation of an infrastructure object (e.g., virtual machines, databases, networks) that Terraform manages.
-   Resources are declared with a resource type and a unique name, and they define the desired state of the infrastructure.

    ```ini
    resource "RESOURCE_TYPE" "RESOURCE_NAME" {
        # Configuration settings for the resource

        ATTRIBUTE_NAME = ATTRIBUTE_VALUE
        # Additional attribute configurations
    }
    ```

    ```ini
        resource "aws_instance" "example" {
        ami = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
        instance_type = "t2.micro"
    }
    ```

##### Module

-   A self-contained unit of Terraform configuration that represents a set of resources and can be reused.

-   Modules are defined using the module block and can be sourced locally or from external repositories.

    ```ini
    module "example" {
        source = "./path/to/module"
    }
    ```

##### Variable

-   A parameter that can be passed to Terraform configurations to make them more dynamic and reusable.
-   Variables are declared in the configuration and can be assigned values directly or through variable files.

    ```ini
    variable "region" {
        description = "AWS region"
        type = string
        default = "us-east-1"
    }
    ```

##### Output

-   Values that are optionally exported from a Terraform configuration, providing a way to share information with other configurations.
-   Outputs are defined using the `output` block and can be used to display or pass values between configurations.

    ```ini
    output "instance_ip" {
        value = aws_instance.example.public_ip
    }
    ```

##### State

-   The current state of the infrastructure being managed by Terraform, including resource IDs, metadata, and other information.
-   State files (usually `terraform.tfstate`) store the current state and are essential for tracking changes and ensuring **idempotency**.

##### Terraform CLI

-   The command-line interface for interacting with Terraform, enabling users to apply, plan, and destroy infrastructure.
    Commands: Common commands include terraform init, terraform plan, terraform apply, and terraform destroy.

##### Terraform Cloud

-   A hosted service by HashiCorp that provides collaboration, versioning, and automation features for Terraform configurations.
    Usage: Terraform Cloud facilitates remote execution of Terraform runs, workspace management, and collaboration among team members.

-   **terraform.tfstate**:

    -   This file stores the current state of your infrastructure. It includes details about the resources that Terraform manages, their current configuration, and metadata.
    -   It's usually in JSON format and can be quite large, depending on the size and complexity of your infrastructure.
    -   It Should be stored securely because it contains sensitive information about your infrastructure.

-   **terraform.tfstate.backup**:

    -   This file is a backup of the previous state. Before Terraform makes changes to your infrastructure, it creates a backup of the existing state in this file.
    -   It's useful in case something goes wrong during an apply, and you need to roll back to the previous state.
    -   While it's good to keep a backup, you might not want to version control it, especially if it contains sensitive information. Ensure it's stored securely.

-   **.terraform.lock.hcl**:

    -   This file is related to Terraform's dependency locking mechanism. It's used to lock down the versions of providers and modules to ensure that subsequent runs use the same versions as the original deployment.
    -   It's generally used in conjunction with terraform init and is crucial for ensuring consistency in a team or CI/CD environment.
    -   This file should be version controlled along with your Terraform configuration files. It ensures that everyone working on the project uses the same versions of providers and modules.

#### [Terraform Configuration Syntex](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/syntax/configuration)

-   `Arguments`: An argument assigns a value to a particular name:

    ```ini
    image_id = "abc123"
    ```

    -   The identifier before the equals sign is the argument name, and the expression after the equals sign is the argument's value.

-   `Identifiers`:

    -   Argument names, block type names, and the names of most Terraform-specific constructs like resources, input variables, etc. are all identifiers.
    -   Identifiers can contain letters, digits, underscores (`_`), and hyphens (`-`). The first character of an identifier must not be a digit, to avoid ambiguity with literal numbers.

-   `Comments`: The Terraform language supports three different syntaxes for comments:

    -   `#` begins a single-line comment, ending at the end of the line.
    -   `//` also begins a single-line comment, as an alternative to `#`.
    -   `/*` and `*/` are start and end delimiters for a comment that might span over multiple lines.

-   <details><summary style="font-size:18px;color:Orange;text-align:left">Blocks</summary>

    ```ini
    resource "aws_instance" "example" {
        ami = "abc123"

        network_interface {
            # ...
        }
    }
    ```

    -   A block has a type (resource in this example). Each block type defines how many labels must follow the type keyword. The resource block type expects two labels, which are aws_instance and example in the example above. A particular block type may have any number of required labels, or it may require none as with the nested network_interface block type.
    -   After the block type keyword and any labels, the block body is delimited by the { and } characters. Within the block body, further arguments and blocks may be nested, creating a hierarchy of blocks and their associated arguments.

    ##### [Resource](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources) Block

    ##### [Data](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/data-sources) Block

    </details>

#### [`Variables` and `Outputs`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values):

-   If you're familiar with traditional programming languages, it can be useful to compare Terraform's

    -   `modules` to function definitions.
    -   `Input` variables are like function arguments.
    -   `Output` values are like function return values.
    -   `Local` values are like a function's temporary local variables.

-   **Input Variables**:

    -   Input variables let you customize aspects of Terraform modules without altering the module's own source code. This functionality allows you to share modules across different Terraform configurations, making your module composable and reusable.
    -   When you declare variables in the root module of your configuration, you can set their values using CLI options and environment variables. When you declare them in child modules, the calling module should pass values in the module block.
    -   Each input variable accepted by a module must be declared using a variable block

        ```ini
        variable "image_id" {
            type = string
        }

        variable "availability_zone_names" {
            type    = list(string)
            default = ["us-west-1a"]
        }

        variable "docker_ports" {
            type = list(object({
                internal = number
                external = number
                protocol = string
            }))
            default = [
                {
                    internal = 8300
                    external = 8300
                    protocol = "tcp"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

-   **Output Variables**: Output values make information about your infrastructure available on the command line, and can expose information for other Terraform configurations to use. Output values are similar to return values in programming languages.

    ```ini
    # main.tf

    module "foo" {
        source = "./mod"
    }
    resource "test_instance" "x" {
        some_attribute = module.foo.a # resource attribute references a sensitive output
    }
    output "out" {
        value     = "xyz"
        sensitive = true
    }

    # mod/main.tf, our module containing a sensitive output

    output "a" {
        value     = "secret"
        sensitive = true
    }
    ```

-   **Local Variables**: A local value assigns a name to an expression, so you can use the name multiple times within a module instead of repeating the expression.

    ```ini
    locals {
        # Ids for multiple sets of EC2 instances, merged together
        instance_ids = concat(aws_instance.blue.*.id, aws_instance.green.*.id)
        }

        locals {
            # Common tags to be assigned to all resources
            common_tags = {
                Service = local.service_name
                Owner   = local.owner
            }
        }

    ```

-   **Data** Block: In Terraform, the data block is used to retrieve and expose data from various sources, such as cloud providers, external APIs, or other Terraform-managed resources. The data retrieved using a data block can then be used within the Terraform configuration to make decisions, configure resources, or provide input values.

    -   In Terraform, the data specified within a data block is retrieved during the planning phase of the Terraform workflow. Specifically, the data retrieval occurs when Terraform executes the terraform plan, terraform apply, or terraform refresh commands. Here's how the data retrieval process works:

    -   `Plan Phase`:

        -   During the plan phase (terraform plan), Terraform examines the configuration files and determines the actions necessary to achieve the desired state described in the configuration.
        -   When Terraform encounters a data block, it evaluates the configuration settings specified within the block to determine how to retrieve the requested data.
        -   Terraform builds a dependency graph based on the relationships between resources and data sources, ensuring that data retrieval occurs in the correct order.

    -   `Data Retrieval`:

        -   Once Terraform has determined the dependencies and the order in which data sources should be queried, it begins the data retrieval process.
        -   Terraform communicates with the appropriate data sources (e.g., cloud providers, external APIs) based on the configuration settings specified within the data block.
        -   The data is retrieved from the sources and stored in memory within the Terraform process.

    -   `Dependency Resolution`:

        -   If a data block depends on other resources or data sources, Terraform ensures that those dependencies are resolved first before retrieving the data.
        -   For example, if a data block depends on an AWS VPC, Terraform will first ensure that the VPC resource is created or retrieved before attempting to query other data sources related to the VPC.

    -   `Plan Generation`:

        -   After retrieving the necessary data, Terraform incorporates that data into the plan it generates.
        -   The plan includes any changes or actions required to achieve the desired state described in the configuration, including the use of the retrieved data in resource configurations or other parts of the configuration.

    -   `Apply Phase`:

        -   During the apply phase (terraform apply), Terraform executes the actions specified in the plan, including the creation, modification, or deletion of resources, and applies any changes to the infrastructure.
        -

-   **Module**: A module in Terraform is a set of Terraform configuration files that define a specific set of infrastructure resources and settings. It encapsulates related resources and configurations, making them reusable across multiple Terraform configurations.

    -   A module is a container for multiple resources that are used together.
    -   Every Terraform configuration has at least one module, known as its root module, which consists of the resources defined in the .tf files in the main working directory.
    -   A module can call other modules, which lets you include the child module's resources into the configuration in a concise way. Modules can also be called multiple times, either within the same configuration or in separate configurations, allowing resource configurations to be packaged and re-used.
    -   To call a module means to include the contents of that module into the configuration with specific values for its input variables. Modules are called from within other modules using module blocks:

        ```ini
        module "servers" {
            source = "./app-cluster"
            servers = 5
        }
        ```

#### [Expressions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions)

-   **Other expression types:**

    -   For expressions
    -   Splat expressions
    -   Dynamic blocks
    -   Type constraints
    -   Version constraints

#### Collections

1. `Lists`:

    - Lists define ordered collections of values. Example:

    ```ini
    # Declare a list of availability zones
    variable "availability_zones" {
        type    = list(string)
        default = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b", "us-west-2c"]
    }
    ```

2. `Maps`:

    - Maps allow you to create key-value pairs for organizing and accessing data. Example:

    ```ini
    # Declare a map for tags
    variable "tags" {
        type    = map(string)
        default = { "env" : "dev", "app" : "web" }
    }
    ```

3. `For Each`:

    - The for_each expression is used for resource iteration. Example:

    ```ini
    # Use for_each to create multiple instances of an AWS EC2 instance
    resource "aws_instance" "example" {
        for_each = toset(["a", "b", "c"])

        ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
        instance_type = "t2.micro"
    }

    # Define a set of instance names
    variable "instance_names" {
        type    = set(string)
        default = ["web", "db", "cache"]
    }

    # Create multiple instances using for_each
    resource "aws_instance" "example" {
        for_each = var.instance_names

        ami           = "ami-12345678"
        instance_type = "t2.micro"
        tags = {
            Name = each.key
        }
    }

    # Access set elements in a resource
    resource "aws_instance" "example" {
        for_each = var.instance_names

        ami           = "ami-12345678"
        instance_type = "t2.micro"
        tags = {
            Name = each.key
        }
    }


    # Define a map of instance configurations
    variable "instance_configurations" {
        type = map(object({
            ami           = string
            instance_type = string
        }))
        default = {
            web   = { ami = "ami-12345678", instance_type = "t2.micro" }
            db    = { ami = "ami-87654321", instance_type = "t2.small" }
            cache = { ami = "ami-56781234", instance_type = "t2.nano" }
        }
    }

    # Create multiple instances using for_each
    resource "aws_instance" "example" {
        for_each = var.instance_configurations

        ami           = each.value.ami
        instance_type = each.value.instance_type
        tags = {
            Name = each.key
        }
    }
    ```

<details open><summary style="font-size:25px;color:Orange;text-align:left">Terraform Interview Questions</summary>

**Terraform Basics**:

<details><summary style="font-size:18px;color:#C71585">What is Terraform, and why is it used?</summary>

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used for provisioning and managing infrastructure in a declarative manner.

</details>

<details><summary style="font-size:18px;color:#C71585">Explain the difference between declarative and imperative programming in the context of Terraform.</summary>

Declarative programming describes the desired state, while imperative programming describes the steps to achieve that state. Terraform is declarative, specifying what infrastructure should exist.

</details>

<details><summary style="font-size:18px;color:#C71585">What is the purpose of Terraform providers?</summary>

Providers in Terraform are responsible for understanding and interacting with APIs of specific infrastructure platforms. The "aws" provider, for example, manages resources on AWS.

</details>

**Terraform Configuration**:

<details><summary style="font-size:18px;color:#C71585">What is the Terraform configuration file, and what extension does it have?</summary>

A Terraform configuration file is a script or a set of files written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) that defines the infrastructure and resources to be provisioned or managed by Terraform. These files typically have a `*.tf` extension. The configuration specifies the infrastructure components, their relationships, configurations, and other details necessary for provisioning and managing infrastructure.

</details>

<details><summary style="font-size:18px;color:#C71585">Explain the perpose of the `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`, `terraform destroy` commands.</summary>

-   `terraform init`: Initializes the Terraform working directory, downloading necessary provider plugins and configuring the backend.
-   `terraform plan`: Creates an execution plan, displaying the changes Terraform will apply to the infrastructure without actually making modifications.
-   `terraform apply`: Applies the planned changes to the infrastructure, creating or updating resources according to the Terraform configuration.
-   `terraform destroy`: Initiates the destruction of provisioned resources, reverting the infrastructure to its pre-deployment state.

</details>

<details><summary style="font-size:18px;color:#C71585">Explain the purpose of the `terraform.tfstate`, `terraform.tfstate.backup`, and `terraform.lock.hcl` file.</summary>

-   **terraform.tfstate**: It is the default Terraform state file that records the current state of the infrastructure managed by Terraform, including resource metadata, dependencies, and attribute values
-   **terraform.tfstate.backup**: A backup of the previous state file (terraform.tfstate) created automatically before each terraform apply, providing a fallback in case of accidental data loss or errors during the apply process.
-   **terraform.lock.hcl**: The terraform.lock.hcl file is a lock file generated by Terraform when using Terraform 0.14 and later versions. It is used to lock the versions of providers and modules used in a Terraform configuration to ensure reproducibility and consistency across different environments and executions.

    -   `Purpose`:

        -   The terraform.lock.hcl file records the exact versions of providers and modules used in a Terraform configuration when it is initialized or updated.
        -   It serves as a lock file to freeze the versions of dependencies, preventing unexpected changes in the versions of providers and modules during subsequent executions.

    -   `Usage`:

        -   When running terraform init, Terraform checks for the presence of the terraform.lock.hcl file in the working directory.
        -   If the lock file exists, Terraform installs the exact versions of providers and modules specified in the file, ensuring that the same versions are used consistently across environments.
        -   If the lock file does not exist, Terraform generates one based on the current configuration and installed versions of providers and modules.

    -   `Managing Dependencies`:

        -   The terraform.lock.hcl file simplifies dependency management by providing a deterministic way to specify and track dependencies.
        -   It helps avoid unexpected changes in dependencies due to updates or changes in upstream sources, ensuring that infrastructure deployments are reproducible and reliable.

    -   By using the terraform.lock.hcl file, Terraform users can achieve greater confidence in the consistency and reliability of their infrastructure deployments, as it helps ensure that the same versions of providers and modules are used across different environments and executions.

</details>

<details><summary style="font-size:18px;color:#C71585">What is Terraform backend? Explain the purpose of Terraform Backends.</summary>

-   Terraform backend is a configuration block that defines where and how Terraform stores its state files. The state file contains information about the infrastructure managed by Terraform, such as resource metadata, dependencies, and attribute values.
-   There are various types of backends supported by Terraform, including local, remote, and enhanced backends. Some popular backends include:

    -   `Local Backend`: Stores the state file on the local disk. This is the default if no backend configuration is provided. It is suitable for solo developers working on small projects.
    -   `Remote Backends` (e.g., Amazon S3, Azure Storage, Google Cloud Storage): Store the state file remotely, allowing collaboration and better management of infrastructure. Remote backends often include additional features like state locking to prevent conflicts during concurrent operations.
    -   `Terraform Cloud/Enterprise Backend`: Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise are managed services that provide collaboration features, remote state storage, and other enterprise-level capabilities.

<details><summary style="font-size:18px;color:#C71585">How does Terraform handle secrets or sensitive information?</summary>

Terraform provides the sensitive argument for variables to mark sensitive information. Secrets can also be stored in environment variables.

Terraform provides several mechanisms for handling secrets or sensitive information securely:

-   **Sensitive Data Handling**: Terraform offers the sensitive argument to mark sensitive values within resources. When a value is marked as sensitive, Terraform will prevent it from being displayed in the plan or any output, including state files.

    ```ini
    resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "example" {
        name = "example"
        secret_string = "super_secret_value"
        sensitive = true
    }
    ```

-   **Backend Configuration**: Terraform's backend configuration can be used to specify where state data is stored. It is recommended to use a backend that supports encryption and access control, such as Amazon S3 with server-side encryption enabled.

    ```ini
    terraform {
        backend "s3" {
            bucket = "example-bucket"
            key = "terraform/state.tfstate"
            region = "us-east-1"
            dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock"
            encrypt = true
        }
    }
    ```

-   **Input Variables and Environment Variables**: Input variables can be defined in Terraform configuration files to parameterize configurations. When sensitive information is required as input, it is recommended to use environment variables or input variables defined in separate files that are not checked into source control.

    ```ini
    variable "db_password" {
        type = string
        default = ""
    }
    ```

-   **Provider Credentials**: Provider credentials, such as AWS access keys or Azure Service Principal credentials, should be managed using secure mechanisms provided by the respective cloud provider. For example, AWS IAM roles or Azure Managed Identities can be used to provide credentials securely without exposing them in Terraform configuration files.
-   **Secrets Management Integration**: Terraform integrates with third-party secrets management solutions, such as HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager, to manage sensitive information securely. These solutions can be used to store and retrieve secrets dynamically during Terraform execution.

    ```ini
    data "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "example" {
        name = "example"
    }

    resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
    # ...
        password = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret.example.secret_string
    }
    ```

By leveraging these mechanisms, Terraform enables secure handling of secrets and sensitive information, reducing the risk of exposure and ensuring compliance with security best practices.

</details>

<details><summary style="font-size:18px;color:#C71585">What is the terraform import command? How is it used</summary>

-   The terraform import command in Terraform is used to bring an existing resource under Terraform management. This is particularly useful when you have infrastructure that was created outside of Terraform, and you want to start managing it using Terraform without recreating or modifying the resource.
-   `$ terraform import aws_instance.example i-0c1234567890abcdef`
-   After running terraform import, Terraform will create an entry in the state file (terraform.tfstate) for the imported resource. However, this doesn't automatically generate a Terraform configuration for the resource. You'll need to manually write the Terraform configuration to match the existing resource's configuration.
-   Once the resource is imported and you've created a corresponding Terraform configuration, you can use Terraform commands like terraform plan and terraform apply to manage the resource going forward.
-   Keep in mind that not all resources are fully importable, and you might need to manually configure additional settings in your Terraform configuration to match the existing resource's configuration. Always refer to the Terraform documentation for specifics on each resource type.
