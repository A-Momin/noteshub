-   [ByteByteGo: Top 6 Most Popular API Architecture Styles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vLxWqE94l4&t=20s)

API paradigms refer to the different styles or architectural patterns used in designing and implementing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Each paradigm has its own principles, use cases, and communication models. Here’s a list of the most common API paradigms:

#### REST (Representational State Transfer)

-   **Principles**: RESTful APIs are based on the principles of stateless communication, where each request from a client to a server must contain all the information the server needs to fulfill the request. REST uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and is resource-oriented.
-   **Data Format**: Typically JSON or XML.
-   **Use Cases**: Web services, CRUD operations, microservices.
-   **Advantages**: Simplicity, scalability, statelessness, and wide adoption.

#### gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)

-   **Principles**: RPC-based APIs allow clients to execute a function or procedure on a remote server as if it were local. The communication typically involves calling a method with parameters, and the server returns the result.
-   **Variants**:
    -   **JSON-RPC**: Uses JSON for encoding messages.
    -   **XML-RPC**: Uses XML for encoding messages.
    -   **gRPC**: A modern RPC framework developed by Google that uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for message serialization.
-   **Data Format**: JSON, XML, Protocol Buffers.
-   **Use Cases**: Distributed systems, microservices, performance-critical applications.
-   **Advantages**: Efficient, supports multiple languages, easy-to-understand method-based calls.

#### SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

-   **Principles**: SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services. It uses XML as its message format and relies on various other protocols like HTTP, SMTP, and more.
-   **Data Format**: XML.
-   **Use Cases**: Enterprise applications, legacy systems, complex transactions, and environments requiring strict standards (e.g., banking, healthcare).
-   **Advantages**: Strong standards (security, transaction management), language-agnostic, supports complex operations.

#### GraphQL

-   **Principles**: Developed by Facebook, GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. Unlike REST, where multiple endpoints might be needed to get related data, a single GraphQL query can fetch all the required data in one request.
-   **Data Format**: JSON (for requests and responses).
-   **Use Cases**: Modern web and mobile applications, real-time data fetching, scenarios where minimizing the number of requests is crucial.
-   **Advantages**: Flexible queries, reduced over-fetching or under-fetching of data, strong typing, introspection.

#### WebSockets

-   **Principles**: WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection. It’s often used for real-time, two-way interaction between clients and servers.
-   **Data Format**: Typically JSON, but can support binary data.
-   **Use Cases**: Real-time applications (e.g., chat applications, live notifications, gaming), IoT, streaming data.
-   **Advantages**: Low latency, real-time communication, efficient for use cases requiring constant updates.

#### Event-Driven APIs

-   **Principles**: Event-driven APIs work by emitting and listening to events. When a particular event occurs, the system reacts by executing a predefined action. This paradigm is often used in real-time or asynchronous systems.
-   **Data Format**: JSON, XML, or custom formats depending on the implementation.
-   **Use Cases**: Real-time notifications, streaming data, IoT, complex workflows with triggers and actions.
-   **Advantages**: Decoupled systems, scalability, real-time processing, asynchronous communication.

#### WebHooks

-   **Principles**: WebHooks are a lightweight paradigm where a server-side application makes an HTTP POST request to a specified URL in response to some event. They are often used to notify other systems of events like new data being available.
-   **Data Format**: JSON, XML, or any format that can be sent via HTTP POST.
-   **Use Cases**: Integration between services (e.g., triggering CI/CD pipelines, notifications, updates).
-   **Advantages**: Simplicity, efficient for event notifications, no need for polling.

#### Pub/Sub (Publish/Subscribe)

-   **Principles**: In a Pub/Sub model, messages are published to a topic, and subscribers to that topic receive the messages. The publisher and subscriber are decoupled and do not communicate directly.
-   **Data Format**: JSON, XML, Protocol Buffers, or other formats depending on the implementation.
-   **Use Cases**: Real-time messaging, event-driven architectures, distributed systems.
-   **Advantages**: Scalability, decoupling of components, support for complex event processing.

#### Summary

-   **REST**: Resource-based, HTTP methods, simple and widely adopted.
-   **RPC**: Function calls, method-based, efficient, often used in microservices.
-   **SOAP**: Protocol-based, strong standards, XML, used in enterprise systems.
-   **GraphQL**: Flexible queries, minimizes over-fetching, strong typing.
-   **WebSockets**: Real-time, full-duplex communication.
-   **Event-Driven APIs**: Asynchronous, real-time, decoupled.
-   **WebHooks**: Event notifications via HTTP POST, simple integration.
-   **Pub/Sub**: Decoupled messaging, real-time, scalable.

Each paradigm has its strengths and is suited to different scenarios, so the choice of API paradigm often depends on the specific requirements of the application or system being developed.

API stands for "Application Programming Interface." An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. APIs are used to enable the integration of different software systems, allowing them to communicate and work together. Here are key aspects of APIs:

-   **Communication between Software Components**: APIs define how different software components should interact. They act as a bridge, allowing one application to access the functionality or data of another.
-   **Abstraction Layer**: APIs provide an abstraction layer that hides the internal complexities of the system or service, exposing only what is necessary for external users or applications.
-   **Methods and Endpoints**: APIs expose methods (functions) and endpoints (URLs or URIs) that define the operations or resources available for interaction. These methods and endpoints are like the building blocks that developers can use.
-   **Data Formats**: APIs define the data formats in which information is exchanged. Common formats include JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language).
-   **HTTP and RESTful APIs**: Many APIs use HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) as the communication protocol. REST (Representational State Transfer) is a commonly used architectural style for designing networked applications, and RESTful APIs adhere to REST principles.
-   **Authentication and Authorization**: APIs often include mechanisms for authentication and authorization to control access to resources. This ensures that only authorized users or applications can make use of the API.
-   **Third-Party Integration**: APIs are crucial for enabling third-party developers to integrate their applications or services with existing platforms, services, or data sources.
-   **Web APIs vs. Library APIs**: Web APIs are typically accessed over the internet using standard protocols, while library APIs are sets of routines or tools for building software and are often used within the same programming language.
    -   `Web APIs`: Services like Twitter, Google Maps, or OpenWeatherMap provide APIs that developers can use to access their data or functionality.
    -   `Library APIs`: Libraries in programming languages, like the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++ or the Python Standard Library, expose APIs for developers to use predefined functions and classes. APIs play a fundamental role in modern software development by facilitating the creation of modular, interoperable, and scalable applications. They enable the integration of different systems and contribute to the development of a vibrant ecosystem of interconnected applications and services.

#### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) APIs

An HTTP API (HyperText Transfer Protocol Application Programming Interface) is a way for applications to communicate with each other over the web using the HTTP protocol. It allows clients (such as web browsers, mobile apps, or other servers) to send requests to a server, which then processes the requests and sends back responses.

In essence, an HTTP API exposes certain endpoints (URLs) that clients can interact with, using standard HTTP methods like GET (to retrieve data), POST (to send data), PUT (to update data), and DELETE (to remove data). This interaction facilitates the exchange of data and services between different software systems.

HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a fundamental protocol used for communication on the World Wide Web. It is an application layer protocol that facilitates the transfer of hypertext, which includes text, images, videos, and other multimedia files, over the internet. Here are key terms and concepts associated with HTTP:

-   **Client and Server**: In the context of HTTP, the client is typically a web browser or a similar application that requests resources, while the server is a computer hosting those resources and responding to client requests.
-   **Request-Response Model**: HTTP follows a request-response model. The client sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server responds with the requested data or an error message.
-   **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**: A URL is a string of characters that provides the address used to access a resource on the web. It includes the protocol (e.g., http://), the domain name, and the path to the resource.
-   <details><summary><b style="color:white">HTTP Methods</b>: HTTP methods or verbs are some action words or methods which indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource. Common HTTP methods include:</summary>

    -   <b style="color:#C71585">GET</b>: Retrieve data from a resource.

        -   `Idempotent`: Yes. Repeated GET requests should have the same effect as a single request.
        -   `Example`: Fetch the details of a product by requesting GET `/products/123`.
            -   `$ curl http://localhost:8000/products/123`

    -   <b style="color:#C71585">POST</b>: Used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource. It can also be used to create a new resource.

        -   `Idempotent`: No. Repeated POST requests with the same data will create multiple resources.
        -   `Example`: Create a new product by sending data to POST `/products`.
            -   `$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "New Product", "price": 19.99}' http://localhost:8000/products/`

    -   <b style="color:#C71585">PUT</b>: The PUT method is used to update or create a resource at a specific URI. It essentially replaces the current representation of the target resource with the request payload.

        -   `Use Case`: PUT is typically used when the client has the full representation of the resource and wants to replace the existing resource at the specified URI.
        -   `Idempotent`: Yes. Multiple identical PUT requests will result in the same resource state; if you put the same data multiple times, the result will remain unchanged after the first request.
        -   `Example 0`: Update product information by sending data to PUT `/products/123` using curl.
            -   `$ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Updated Product", "price": 24.99}' http://localhost:8000/products/123/`
        -   `Example 1`: Update product information by sending data to PUT `/products/123` in Django.

            ```python
            # views.py
            from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404
            from rest_framework.views import APIView
            from rest_framework.response import Response
            from rest_framework import status
            from .models import Product
            from .serializers import ProductSerializer

            class ProductDetailView(APIView):
                def put(self, request, pk):
                    product = get_object_or_404(Product, pk=pk)
                    serializer = ProductSerializer(product, data=request.data)

                    if serializer.is_valid():
                        serializer.save()
                        return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)

                    return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
            ```

        -   `Example 2`: Update product information by sending data to PUT `/products/123` in Django.

            ```python
            # views.py
            from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render, redirect
            from .models import Product
            from .forms import ProductForm

            def product_detail(request, pk):
                product = get_object_or_404(Product, pk=pk)

                if request.method == 'PUT':
                    form = ProductForm(request.PUT, instance=product)
                    if form.is_valid():
                        form.save()
                        return redirect('product_detail', pk=pk)
                else:
                    form = ProductForm(instance=product)

                return render(request, 'product_detail.html', {'form': form})
            ```

        -   `Example 3`: Update product information by sending data to PUT `/products/123` in Django.

            ```python
            # views.py
            from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render, redirect
            from django.http import HttpResponse
            from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt
            from .models import Product
            import json

            @csrf_exempt
            def product_detail(request, pk):
                product = get_object_or_404(Product, pk=pk)

                if request.method == 'PUT':
                    # Retrieve and decode JSON data from the request body
                    try:
                        data = json.loads(request.body.decode('utf-8'))
                    except json.JSONDecodeError:
                        return HttpResponse("Invalid JSON data", status=400)

                    # Update the product with the data
                    product.name = data.get('name', product.name)
                    product.price = data.get('price', product.price)
                    product.save()

                    return HttpResponse("Product updated successfully", status=200)

                return render(request, 'product_detail.html', {'product': product})
            ```

    -   <b style="color:#C71585">PATCH</b>: The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource. Unlike PUT, which replaces the entire resource, PATCH is specifically designed for partial updates.

        -   `Use Case`: PATCH is used when the client wants to apply changes to specific fields of a resource without affecting the entire representation. It is more bandwidth-efficient when dealing with large resources.
        -   `Idempotent`: It depends on the implementation. While PATCH is intended to be idempotent, achieving true idempotence can be challenging since the server must interpret the partial update in a consistent manner.
        -   `Example`: Update only the email address of a user by sending data to PATCH `/users/123`.

            ```python
            @csrf_exempt  # For demonstration purposes; CSRF should be handled properly in production
            def patch_my_model(request, pk):
                try:
                    user = get_object_or_404(User, pk=pk)
                except User.DoesNotExist:
                    return JsonResponse({'error': 'Instance not found'}, status=404)

                if request.method == 'PATCH':
                    data = json.loads(request.body.decode('utf-8'))
                    # Update only the fields present in the request
                    for key, value in data.items():
                        setattr(user, key, value)
                    instance.save()
                    return JsonResponse({'message': 'Instance updated successfully'})
                else:
                    return JsonResponse({'error': 'Unsupported method'}, status=400)
            ```

    -   <b style="color:#C71585">DELETE</b>: Remove a resource from the server.

        -   `Idempotent`: Yes. Deleting the same resource multiple times will have the same effect as deleting it once. If the resource is already deleted, subsequent DELETE requests will typically return a success status indicating the resource does not exist.
        -   `Example`: Delete a user by sending a request to DELETE `/users/123`. Sending the same DELETE request again won't change the fact that the resource has already been deleted. This characteristic simplifies error handling and makes it safer to retry requests without worrying about unintended side effects.

    -   <b style="color:#C71585">HEAD</b>: The HEAD method is used to retrieve the headers of a resource without fetching its body. It is essentially a way to request metadata about a resource without the need to transfer the entire representation. The "HEAD" method allows clients to retrieve metadata about a resource, such as its size or modification date, without downloading the entire content.

        -   `Response`: The server responds to a HEAD request with the headers that would be returned for a corresponding GET request, but without the actual data.
        -   `Use Case`: If a client is interested in obtaining information like the last modification time (Last-Modified), content type, or content length of a resource without downloading the entire resource, a HEAD request can be useful.
        -   `Idempotent`: Yes. Repeated HEAD requests should have the same effect as a single request.
        -   `Example`: Get the headers of a resource without downloading its content using HEAD `/products`.
            -   `$ curl -I http://localhost:8000/products/`

    -   <b style="color:#C71585">OPTIONS</b>: Retrieve information about the communication options for a resource. For example, a Cross-Origin requests may trigger a preflight OPTION request to checks what HTTP methods and headers are allowed by the server.

        -   `Purpose`: The OPTIONS method is used to retrieve the communication options for a given resource or server. It is often used for service discovery and to determine the allowed methods, headers, and other configuration details of an API.
        -   `Response`: The server responds to an OPTIONS request with information about the allowed methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), headers, and any other details that help a client understand how to interact with the resource.
        -   `Use Cases`:

            -   `CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)`: The OPTIONS request is crucial in the context of CORS, where a browser may send a pre-flight OPTIONS request to check if it is allowed to make a subsequent request to a different domain.
            -   `Service Discovery`: In some cases, an OPTIONS request can be used to discover the capabilities of an API, helping clients understand what operations are supported.
            -   `Example`:
                -   `$ curl -X OPTIONS http://localhost:8000/products/`
            -   `Example`:

                ```http
                OPTIONS /api/resource/123 HTTP/1.1
                Host: example.com
                ```

                -   The server responds with information about the allowed methods, headers, etc.

                ```http
                HTTP/1.1 200 OK
                Allow: GET, HEAD, POST, OPTIONS
                Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
                Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS
                ```

        -   `Idempotent`: Yes. Repeated OPTIONS requests should have the same effect as a single request.
        -   `Example`: Determine the available methods and capabilities for a resource using OPTIONS /resource.

    -   <b style="color:#C71585">CONNECT</b>: Used for setting up a network connection to a resource, typically used for proxy servers.

        -   `Purpose`: The CONNECT method is used to establish a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource. It is typically used with the HTTP Secure (HTTPS) protocol to establish a secure connection through an intermediary (such as a proxy server).
        -   `Use Cases`: The primary use case for CONNECT is when a client wants to establish a secure connection to a server through a proxy server. The CONNECT method is used to request that the proxy create a tunnel, and subsequent data is sent over the established tunnel without interpretation by the proxy.
        -   `Idempotent`: No. Since the CONNECT method is often used for setting up connections and tunnels, and the effects may vary (e.g., establishing a new connection or tunnel each time), it is considered non-idempotent. Making multiple CONNECT requests may result in multiple connections being established, and the repeated execution may have different effects.
        -   `Example`: Rarely used directly in RESTful APIs.

            ```http
            CONNECT server.example.com:443 HTTP/1.1
            Host: server.example.com:443
            ```

        -   The client sends a CONNECT request to the proxy server, requesting a tunnel to `server.example.com` on port 443 for establishing a secure connection.
        -   The server responds with a success status if the tunnel is established.

    -   <b style="color:#C71585">TRACE</b>: Used for diagnostic purposes, allows a client to retrieve a diagnostic trace of the actions taken by intermediate servers.

        -   `Purpose`:The TRACE method is used for diagnostic purposes. When a server receives a TRACE request, it echoes the received request back to the client. This can be useful for troubleshooting and understanding how intermediate servers modify the request.

        -   `Use Cases`:Debugging: The primary use case for TRACE is debugging and diagnosing issues in the communication between the client and the server. It allows the client to see how the request is modified as it travels through different proxies and servers.

        -   `Example`: Rarely used directly in RESTful APIs.

            ```http
            TRACE /path/to/resource HTTP/1.1
            Host: example.com
            ```

            -   The server echoes the received request back to the client, and the client can inspect how the request was processed by intermediate servers.

        -   `Idempotent`: Yes.

    </details>

-   <details><summary><b style="color:white">HTTP Response</b>: HTTP responses include status codes that indicate the result of the server's attempt to process the request. Common status code categories include:</summary>

    -   <b style="color:#C71585">1xx Informational</b>: These status codes indicate that the server has received the request and is processing it. They are mainly used for communication purposes and do not represent a final response.

        -   `100 Continue`: The server has received the initial part of the request and expects the client to continue sending the rest of it.
        -   `101 Switching Protocols`: The server is changing the protocol used in the request.

    -   <b style="color:#C71585">2xx Success</b>: These status codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted by the server.

        -   `200 OK`: The request was successful, and the server is returning the requested resource.
        -   `201 Created`: The request was successful, and a new resource was created as a result.

    -   <b style="color:#C71585">3xx Redirection</b>: These status codes indicate that the client needs to take additional steps to complete the request.

        -   `301 Moved Permanently`: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location.
        -   `302 Found`: The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different location.

    -   <b style="color:#C71585">4xx Client Error</b>: These status codes indicate that there was an error on the client's side, and the request cannot be fulfilled.

        -   `400 Bad Request`: The server cannot understand the request due to malformed syntax or other client-side errors.
        -   `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication is required to access the resource, but no valid credentials were provided.
        -   `402 Payment Required`: Reserved for future use, typically for payment-related actions.
        -   `403 Forbidden`: The server understood the request, but the client does not have permission to access the requested resource.
        -   `404 Not Found`: The requested resource could not be found on the server.

    -   <b style="color:#C71585">5xx Server Error</b>: These status codes indicate that there was an error on the server's side, and the request could not be fulfilled.

        -   `500 Internal Server Error`: A generic server error occurred, indicating that something went wrong on the server.
        -   `502 Bad Gateway`: The server acting as a gateway or proxy received an invalid response from an upstream server.

    </details>

-   <details><summary><b style="color:white">HTTP Headers</b>: HTTP headers provide additional information about the request or the response. They include metadata such as content type, content length, and caching directives.</summary>

    1. **Authentication Headers**:

        - `Authorization`: This header is used to pass authentication credentials to the server, typically for securing API endpoints.
            - Example: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (JWT-based)
        - `WWW-Authenticate`: A response header that defines the authentication method to be used to access a resource.
            - Example: `WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Access to the site"`

    2. **Content Headers**:

        - **Content-Type**: Indicates the media type of the resource or the data that is being sent (e.g., JSON, XML).
            - Example: `Content-Type: application/json`
        - **Content-Length**: The size of the request body in bytes. Useful when streaming large files or data to ensure that the content is properly received.
            - Example: `Content-Length: 348`

    3. **Caching Headers**:

        - **Cache-Control**: Specifies caching mechanisms between client and server. It defines how the resource should be cached.
            - Example: `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`

    4. **Client Hints & Context Headers**:

        - **User-Agent**: Identifies the client (browser, mobile app, etc.) that is making the request. In Django, this can be accessed from the `request.META['HTTP_USER_AGENT']` attribute.
            - Example: `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)`
        - **Accept**: Informs the server about the content types that the client is willing to receive.
            - Example: `Accept: application/json`
        - **Accept-Encoding**: Lists the compression methods that the client can handle. Django handles this automatically but can be used for optimizing network payload.
            - Example: `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate`

    5. **Redirection and Location Headers**:

        - **Location**: Used in responses to specify the URL to which a browser should redirect. In Django, it can be set in responses like `HttpResponseRedirect` or `redirect()`.
            - Example: `Location: https://example.com/new-page`

    6. **Request-Control Headers**:

        - **Host**: The domain name of the server (used for virtual hosting). In Django, you can control domain-based logic using `request.get_host()`.
            - Example: `Host: www.example.com`
        - **Origin**: Indicates where the request originates, used primarily in cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) scenarios.
            - Example: `Origin: https://client-site.com`
        - **Referer**: The URL of the page that linked to the resource being requested.
            - Example: `Referer: https://google.com`

    7. **Cookie Headers**: Used to send stored cookies from the client to the server.:

        - Example: `Cookie: sessionid=38afes7a8fe3; csrftoken=1a2b3c4d5e`
        - Django has built-in cookie handling for sessions and CSRF tokens.

    8. **Security Headers**:
        - **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking by controlling whether a page can be framed. In Django, you can configure it via the `X_FRAME_OPTIONS` setting.
            - Example: `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
        - **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**: Informs browsers to only access the site over HTTPS. Django provides built-in support for HSTS via the `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS` setting.
            - Example: `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`

    </details>

-   **Cookies**: Cookies are small pieces of data sent from a server and stored on the client's browser. They are commonly used for user authentication, tracking, and session management.
-   **Session**: A session is a way to persist information across multiple requests and responses between a client and a server. Sessions are often managed using cookies or URL parameters.
-   **Statelessness**: HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning each request from a client to a server is independent, and the server does not retain information about the client's state between requests. Session management mechanisms are used to overcome this limitation.
-   **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**: HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts the data transmitted between the client and the server. It uses SSL/TLS protocols to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the communication.
-   **Websockets**: Websockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived connection. This enables real-time communication between a client and a server.
-   **REST (Representational State Transfer)**: REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It often uses HTTP as the communication protocol and relies on a stateless, client-server interaction.
-   **API Request**: A REST API request is how the client communicates with the server to perform actions like creating, reading, updating, or deleting resources. Each request typically contains:
-   **Query Parameters**: Query parameters are optional key-value pairs appended to the endpoint after a question mark (`?`). They are commonly used to filter, sort, or paginate data. For example:
-   **Path Parameters**: Path parameters are variables within the URL path itself, often used to specify a resource ID. For example, in `/users/123`, `123` is a path parameter representing a specific user.
-   **Endpoint (URL)**: The endpoint, or Uniform Resource Locator (URL), is the address of the resource on the server. It often includes a **base URL** (e.g., `https://api.example.com`) and a **path** to specify the resource (e.g., `/users` or `/products/123`).
-   **Request Validator**: In some APIs, request validators ensure that the incoming request conforms to specific criteria, such as having required fields or matching a defined schema.

Understanding these HTTP terms and concepts is essential for web developers, system administrators, and anyone involved in working with web technologies. HTTP forms the foundation of communication on the internet, and knowledge of its principles is crucial for effective web development and troubleshooting.

#### REST (Representational State Transfer)

-   [Rest API Master Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqwmiTs6Z6PG9-0JT_Zt_gKCxyshjCwEA)

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It was introduced by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation in 2000 and has since become a popular choice for building web services and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

-   **Representational**: The format in which resources are represented (e.g., JSON, XML).
-   **State**: The condition or data of the resource at a given point, managed by the client.
-   **Transfer**: The act of sending and receiving resource representations between client and server over a network.

REST API (Representational State Transfer) is a specific type of HTTP API that follows a set of architectural principles to make it more efficient, scalable, and maintainable. REST API uses a client-server model and is based on the HTTP protocol. It uses standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, and it employs a set of conventions to define resources, URIs, and responses. REST API aims to make the client-server communication stateless and cacheable, and it uses hypermedia (links) to navigate between resources. Here are key terms and concepts associated with REST:

-   **Resource**: In REST, everything is considered a resource. A resource can be a physical object (like an entity in a database), a service, or any other concept that can be identified and addressed.

-   **Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)**:

    -   Resources in REST are identified by URIs.
    -   A URI is a string of characters that uniquely identifies a particular resource.
    -   URIs can be further classified into URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) when they specify the location of the resource, and URNs (Uniform Resource Names) when they only provide a unique name.
    -   URIs are used to identify and interact with resources on the internet.

    -   `Uniform Resource Locator (URL)`:

        -   A URL is a specific type of URI that provides the means to locate and retrieve a resource on the internet.
        -   It includes the protocol used to access the resource (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS), the domain or IP address where the resource is hosted, and the path to the specific resource on that server.
        -   URLs are the most common type of URIs and are used when you want to specify the location of a resource.

-   **HTTP Methods (Verbs)**: RESTful services use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources.

-   **Representation**: Representations are the different ways a resource can be presented or represented. In REST, a resource can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, HTML, or others. Clients interact with resources by exchanging representations. For example, a client might request a user resource and receive a JSON representation of that user.

-   **Idempotence**: An operation is considered idempotent if it produces the same result regardless of how many times it is applied. For example, a GET request is idempotent because retrieving a resource multiple times does not change the resource.

-   [**Content Negotiation**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP9HU1o3zsE): Content negotiation is the process of selecting the appropriate representation of a resource based on the client's preferences. This is often done using the Accept header in HTTP requests.

-   **API Versioning**: To manage changes in an API, versioning is often employed. This can be done through the URI, headers, or other mechanisms, allowing clients to specify the version of the API they wish to use.

#### RESTfull Principles:

-   [Rest API - Best Practices - Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Wl-rtew1_E)

RESTful principles are a set of constraints that guide the design of RESTful systems to ensure simplicity, scalability, and uniformity. The key principles of REST are:

1.  **Client-Server Architecture**:

    -   The client and server are separate entities that communicate over a network.
    -   The client is responsible for the user interface and user experience, while the server is responsible for processing requests, managing resources, and handling business logic.

2.  **Statelessness**:

    -   Statelessness" refers to the fact that the server does not store any client state between requests. Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information necessary for the server to understand and fulfill that request.
    -   The server treats each request it receives as an independent and complete transaction, without relying on any previous requests. This means that there is no dependency accross the requests from clients.

3.  **Uniform Interface**: "Uniform Interface" is one of the key principles of REST architectural style. It defines a standard way for clients and servers to interact with each other. The uniform interface principle is designed to promote simplicity, scalability, and evolvability in distributed systems. It consists of several constraints:

    1.  `Resource Identification`: Resources are identified by unique URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Each resource, whether it's data, a service, or anything else, should have its own URI. The URI serves as the address or identifier for accessing or manipulating the resource.
    2.  `Resource Manipulation through Representations`: In a RESTfull API, clients interact with resources by exchanging representations. When a client requests a resource, it receives a representation of that resource from server, and it can modify or delete the resource by sending the server a new representation. Resources are decoupled from their representation, allowing them to be represented in different formats such as JSON, XML, HTML, etc. The server provides the data and the client can choose how to represent it.

    3.  `Self-Descriptive Messages`: In a RESTful system, communication (request and response messages) between clients and servers should be self-descriptive. This means that request and response messages include all the information needed for the recipient to understand and process the message. For example, headers may specify the content type, allowing the recipient to interpret the body correctly. There are typically two main types of messages exchanged: requests from clients to servers and responses from servers to clients.

        -   `HTTP Request Message (Client to Server)`:

            -   `Method`: The HTTP method (or verb) indicates the desired action to be performed on the resource. Common methods include GET (retrieve a resource), POST (create a new resource), PUT (update a resource), DELETE (remove a resource), etc.
            -   `URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)`: Specifies the identifier of the resource on which the action should be performed. It uniquely identifies the resource within the system.
            -   `Headers`: Additional information about the request, such as content type, accepted response formats, authentication credentials, etc.
            -   `Body (optional)`: In some cases, a request may include a message body. For example, in a POST or PUT request, the body contains data to create or update a resource.

        -   `HTTP Response Message (Server to Client)`:

            -   `Status Code`: Indicates the outcome of the server's attempt to process the request. Common status codes include 200 OK (successful), 201 Created (resource successfully created), 404 Not Found (resource not found), 500 Internal Server Error (server encountered an error), etc.
            -   `Headers`: Provide additional information about the response, such as content type, cache control directives, server information, etc.
            -   `Body (optional)`: Contains the representation of the resource or additional information. For example, in a successful GET request, the body might contain the requested resource in the desired format (JSON, XML, HTML, etc.).

    4.  [`Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK3HNEwDXUk): Server should includes hypermedia controls within API responses to enable dynamic navigation and discoverability. The client navigates through the application by following links in the representations returned by the server. This makes the application more discoverable, enable to have stateless interactions between client and server and allows changes to be made on the server without affecting clients that rely on the hypermedia links. Hence reduce coupling.
        **Hypermedia** is a term that encompasses various media types (such as HTML, XML, or JSON) that support hyperlinks, allowing clients to navigate through the API dynamically.
        **hypermedia controls** refer to the mechanisms by which the server provides information to clients about the available actions or state transitions that can be performed at any given point in the application. Key Concepts of Hypermedia in RESTful API are followings.

        -   `Hypermedia Controls`: The server includes hypermedia controls (links, forms, etc.) within the representations it sends to clients. These controls provide information about the available actions, resources, and state transitions that clients can access.

        -   `Discoverability`: Since hypermedia links provided in the responses, clients can dynamically discover and navigate the API by following those links instead of hardcoding URLs.

        -   `Stateless Interaction`: In RESTful architecture hypermedia supports stateless interactions by including all the necessary information for clients to navigate and interact within each response and clients maintain the state of the application based on the information provided in the hypermedia controls.

        -   `Reduced Coupling`: Since clients only rely on the information provided in the hypermedia links, server can make any changes without affecting clients that rely on the hypermedia links.

        -   `Media Types`: a "media type" refers to a standardized way of indicating the type of data being transmitted between a client and a server. It specifies the format and structure of the data, allowing both parties to understand how to interpret and process the information.

        -   <details><summary><b style="color:white">Links and Link Relations</b>: Link relations in HATEOAS play a crucial role in defining the semantics of hypermedia links. A link relation is a way to express the meaning or purpose of a link. It provides a standardized way for clients to understand the relationship between the current resource and linked resources. Some common link relations used in HATEOAS include:</summary>

            -   **Self (self)**: The self link relation is used to provide a link back to the current resource. It allows the client to retrieve information about the current state or resource.

                ```json
                {
                    "links": [{ "rel": "self", "href": "/api/resource/123" }],
                    "data": {
                        /* ... */
                    }
                }
                ```

            -   **Related (related)**: The related link relation is used to indicate a related resource. It might provide links to associated resources that can be useful for the client.

                ```json
                {
                    "links": [
                        { "rel": "related", "href": "/api/other_resource" }
                    ],
                    "data": {
                        /* ... */
                    }
                }
                ```

            -   **Next (next) and Previous (prev)**: These link relations are often used in paginated results to navigate to the next or previous set of resources.

                ```json
                {
                    "links": [
                        { "rel": "next", "href": "/api/resources?page=2" },
                        { "rel": "prev", "href": "/api/resources?page=1" }
                    ],
                    "data": [
                        /* ... */
                    ]
                }
                ```

            -   **Create (create), Update (update), and Delete (delete)**: These link relations may be used to indicate the actions a client can take to create, update, or delete a resource.

                ```json
                {
                    "links": [
                        {
                            "rel": "create",
                            "href": "/api/resources",
                            "method": "POST"
                        },
                        {
                            "rel": "update",
                            "href": "/api/resource/123",
                            "method": "PUT"
                        },
                        {
                            "rel": "delete",
                            "href": "/api/resource/123",
                            "method": "DELETE"
                        }
                    ],
                    "data": {
                        /* ... */
                    }
                }
                ```

            -   **Profile (profile)**: The profile link relation can be used to indicate a link to a resource that provides additional information about the resource's representation format or profile.

                ```json
                {
                    "links": [
                        {
                            "rel": "profile",
                            "href": "/api/profiles/resource_profile"
                        }
                    ],
                    "data": {
                        /* ... */
                    }
                }
                ```

            -   Other Common link relations include "first," "last," and custom relations specific to the API.
            </details>

4.  **Cacheability**:

    -   Responses from the server can be explicitly marked as cacheable or non-cacheable.
    -   Caching can improve performance and reduce the load on servers by allowing clients to reuse previously fetched representations.

5.  **Layered System**:

    -   The architecture can be composed of multiple layers, with each layer having a specific responsibility and interacting only with adjacent layers.
    -   This helps to achieve scalability, flexibility, and easier maintenance.

6.  **Code-On-Demand (Optional)**:

    -   Servers can temporarily extend the functionality of a client by transferring logic in the form of applets or scripts.
    -   This constraint is optional and not always used in RESTful architectures.

#### HTTP API vs REST API

HTTP API and REST API are terms often used interchangeably, but they represent different concepts. Let's clarify the distinctions between them:

-   `HTTP API`:

    -   An HTTP API (Application Programming Interface) is a general term for an interface that allows one software application to interact with another over the HTTP protocol.
    -   It doesn't prescribe a specific architectural style or set of constraints.
    -   An HTTP API can use various design patterns and data formats for communication, including SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), XML-RPC, or custom protocols.
    -   It may not adhere to the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer) and might not leverage HTTP methods and status codes in a RESTful manner.

-   `REST API`:

    -   REST, on the other hand, is a specific architectural style for designing networked applications, and a REST API is an API that follows the principles of REST.
    -   RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform operations on resources, and they often use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the result of a request.
    -   REST APIs typically involve stateless communication, a uniform and consistent interface, resource-based URLs, and support for various representation formats (JSON, XML).
    -   HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a key concept in RESTful APIs, where clients interact with the application entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by application servers.

In summary, while an HTTP API refers to any API that uses the HTTP protocol for communication, a REST API specifically adheres to the principles of REST. RESTful APIs leverage the standard features of HTTP and follow a set of constraints to achieve a scalable, maintainable, and uniform architecture. It's important to note that not all APIs that use HTTP are necessarily RESTful, and the distinction lies in whether they follow the principles of REST.

#### OpenAPI

OpenAPI, formerly known as Swagger, is a specification for building APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It provides a standardized way to describe RESTful APIs, allowing both humans and computers to understand the capabilities of a service without access to its source code. OpenAPI is often used to design, document, and consume APIs. Here are key aspects of OpenAPI:

1. **Specification Format**:
    - `YAML or JSON`: OpenAPI specifications can be written in either YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). YAML is often preferred for its human-readable and clean syntax.
2. **API Documentation**:
    - `Human-Readable Documentation`: OpenAPI specifications serve as a comprehensive documentation for APIs. Developers can easily understand how to interact with the API, including available endpoints, request/response formats, authentication methods, and more.
    - `Interactive Documentation`: Tools like Swagger UI or ReDoc can generate interactive documentation directly from the OpenAPI specification, allowing users to explore and test API endpoints interactively.
3. **API Design**:
    - `Design-First Approach`: OpenAPI encourages a design-first approach to building APIs. Developers can create the API specification before implementing the actual service, fostering collaboration between development teams and stakeholders.
4. **Key Components**:
    - `Paths and Operations`: Define endpoints (paths) and operations (HTTP methods) supported by the API.
    - `Parameters`: Specify parameters for requests, including path parameters, query parameters, headers, and request bodies.
    - `Responses`: Describe the possible responses from API endpoints, including status codes and response bodies.
    - `Security Definitions`: Define security requirements and authentication mechanisms.
5. **Code Generation**:
    - `Client Code`: OpenAPI specifications can be used to generate client code in various programming languages, reducing the effort required to consume an API.
    - `Server Code`: Some tools can also generate server-side code skeletons based on the OpenAPI specification, facilitating the implementation of API services.
6. **Tool Ecosystem**:
    - `Validation Tools`: Tools can validate whether an API implementation conforms to its OpenAPI specification.
    - `Code Generators`: Various code generators can produce client libraries, server stubs, and documentation based on the OpenAPI specification.
    - `Testing Tools`: OpenAPI specifications can be used to generate tests for API endpoints.
7. **Standardization**:
    - `Industry Standard`: OpenAPI is widely adopted as an industry standard for API specifications. Many API-related tools and platforms support OpenAPI, making it easier to integrate and work with different services.

OpenAPI plays a crucial role in promoting API standardization, collaboration, and understanding between different parties involved in the API lifecycle, from design to consumption.

#### OAuth (Open Authorization)

-   [Udacity: Authentication & Authorization: OAuth](https://www.udacity.com/enrollment/ud330)
-   [24. OAuth 2.0: Explained with API Request and Response Sample | High Level System Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gx3e3eLKrg)
-   [ByteByteGo: OAuth 2 Explained In Simple Terms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV5yTm4pT8g)
-   [ByteMonk: OAuth 2.0 explained with examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDuRmhLSLOY&t=288s)

OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard and framework that allows secure third-party access to resources on behalf of a resource owner, without sharing the resource owner's credentials directly. It is commonly used for granting access to web and mobile applications to interact with APIs and services on behalf of users. OAuth provides a standardized way for users to grant limited access to their resources (such as data or services) to another party without exposing their credentials. Key concepts and components of OAuth include:

-   **Roles**:

    -   `Resource Owner`: The entity that owns the protected resource, typically a user.
    -   `Client`: The application requesting access to a protected resource on behalf of the resource owner.
    -   `Authorization Server`: The server that authenticates the resource owner and issues access tokens after obtaining authorization.
    -   `Resource Server`: The server hosting the protected resources that the client wants to access.

-   **Flows/Grant Types**:

    -   `Authorization Code Grant`: Used by web applications where the client can securely retrieve an authorization code by directing the user's browser to an authorization endpoint. The authorization code is then exchanged for an access token.
    -   `Implicit Grant`: Designed for mobile and browser-based applications where the client obtains an access token directly without an intermediate authorization code.
    -   `Client Credentials Grant`: Used when the client is the resource owner and requests access to its resources.
    -   `Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant`: Involves the resource owner's credentials being directly used by the client to obtain an access token.

-   **Access Tokens**:

    -   `Bearer Tokens`: The most common type of access token in OAuth. It is a string representing the authorization granted to the client.
    -   `Token Lifespan`: Access tokens have a limited lifespan and may be short-lived. Refresh tokens can be used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to re-authenticate.

-   **Scopes**:

    -   `Scope`: A parameter that defines the specific permissions or access levels requested by the client. It allows resource owners to control the scope of access granted.

-   **Endpoints**:

    -   `Authorization Endpoint`: Where the resource owner grants authorization to the client.
    -   `Token Endpoint`: Where the client exchanges the authorization code or credentials for an access token.
    -   `Redirection URI`: The URI to which the authorization server redirects the user-agent (browser) after granting or denying access.

-   [REST vs RPC](https://blog.algomaster.io/p/106604fb-b746-41de-88fb-60e932b2ff68)

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol or architectural concept that allows a program to execute a procedure (or function/method) on a remote server as if it were a local function call. This abstraction simplifies the process of building distributed applications, as developers can invoke remote services without worrying about the underlying network communication.

#### Key Concepts and Components of RPC

1. **Client-Server Model**:

    - **Client**: The entity that makes the RPC request, asking the server to perform a particular action.
    - **Server**: The entity that receives the RPC request, executes the requested procedure, and sends the result back to the client.

2. **Procedure Call**:

    - In a traditional local procedure call, a program calls a function or method within the same process. With RPC, this concept is extended to call functions on a remote machine, abstracting the complexities of network communication.

3. **Marshalling and Unmarshalling**:

    - **Marshalling**: The process of converting the procedure parameters into a format that can be transmitted over the network. This typically involves serializing the data into a byte stream.
    - **Unmarshalling**: The reverse process, where the byte stream received from the network is converted back into the original data format (i.e., deserialized) that can be used by the server or client.

4. **Stub or Proxy**:

    - **Client Stub (Proxy)**: A local object that represents the remote function. When a client calls this stub, it handles the marshalling of the parameters and sends the request to the server.
    - **Server Stub (Skeleton)**: On the server side, the stub receives the request, unmarshals the parameters, and calls the actual procedure. After the procedure is executed, it marshals the response and sends it back to the client.

5. **Transport Layer**:

    - RPC relies on a transport protocol to send the request from the client to the server and return the response. Common transport protocols include TCP/IP, HTTP, and sometimes lower-level protocols depending on the implementation.

6. **Communication Flow**:

    - **Step 1**: The client makes a call to a remote procedure as if it were a local function.
    - **Step 2**: The client stub (proxy) marshals the procedure parameters and sends a request message to the server.
    - **Step 3**: The server receives the message, and the server stub (skeleton) unmarshals the parameters.
    - **Step 4**: The server stub calls the actual procedure on the server.
    - **Step 5**: The server procedure executes and returns a result.
    - **Step 6**: The server stub marshals the result and sends it back to the client.
    - **Step 7**: The client stub receives the response, unmarshals it, and passes the result back to the client application.

7. **Error Handling**:
    - RPC introduces new challenges for error handling because the client and server are in different processes, potentially on different machines. Errors can occur due to network issues, server downtime, or failures during marshalling/unmarshalling. RPC systems typically need to provide robust mechanisms for handling timeouts, retries, and reporting errors back to the client.

#### Types of RPC

1. **Synchronous RPC**:

    - The client sends a request and waits (blocks) for the server to process the request and return the response. This is the most common type of RPC.

2. **Asynchronous RPC**:

    - The client sends a request and does not wait for the response immediately. The response is processed in the background, allowing the client to continue executing other tasks.

3. **Batch RPC**:
    - Multiple RPC requests are grouped together and sent to the server in a single message, reducing the overhead of multiple network calls. The server processes each request and sends back a batch response.

#### Protocols and Implementations

1. **JSON-RPC**:

    - A lightweight RPC protocol using JSON for message encoding. It’s commonly used for web applications and services where simplicity and human-readable formats are desirable.

2. **XML-RPC**:

    - Similar to JSON-RPC but uses XML for encoding the request and response messages. It is older and less common than JSON-RPC.

3. **gRPC**:

    - A modern, high-performance RPC framework developed by Google. gRPC uses Protocol Buffers (protobufs) for serializing structured data and supports multiple programming languages. It also supports features like authentication, load balancing, and streaming.

4. **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**:
    - An older protocol that uses XML for message formatting and typically operates over HTTP/HTTPS. Although SOAP is more complex than modern RPC systems like gRPC, it is still used in enterprise environments due to its support for WS-\* standards (e.g., security, transactions).

#### Advantages of RPC

1. **Simplicity**:

    - RPC abstracts the complexity of network communication, making distributed programming easier. Developers can call remote procedures as if they were local functions, without needing to manage sockets, serialization, or protocols directly.

2. **Language Agnostic**:

    - Many RPC systems (like gRPC) support multiple programming languages, making it easier to build services that interact with clients written in different languages.

3. **Performance**:
    - Modern RPC frameworks like gRPC are optimized for performance, with efficient serialization formats (e.g., Protocol Buffers) and support for streaming, which can reduce latency and improve throughput.

#### Disadvantages of RPC

1. **Tight Coupling**:

    - RPC can lead to tight coupling between the client and server since clients need to know the exact methods available on the server. This can make it harder to evolve the API over time.

2. **Complex Error Handling**:

    - Since RPC involves network communication, it introduces new failure modes that are not present in local function calls. Handling these errors requires additional complexity.

3. **Scalability Challenges**:
    - RPC can be less scalable than other architectures like REST, especially in scenarios requiring stateless, cacheable, and scalable interactions typical of large web applications.

#### RPC vs. Other Paradigms

-   **RPC vs. REST**: RPC is procedure-oriented, focusing on invoking remote methods, while REST is resource-oriented, focusing on manipulating resources via standard HTTP methods. REST is typically more scalable and loosely coupled, while RPC is often more efficient for fine-grained operations.

-   **RPC vs. Message Queue**: While RPC focuses on direct calls to remote procedures, message queues (like RabbitMQ) are used for asynchronous communication between distributed components. Message queues are more suitable for decoupling components and handling spikes in workload through buffering.

#### Conclusion

RPC is a powerful paradigm for building distributed systems that require direct, synchronous communication between clients and servers. While it simplifies distributed programming by abstracting the details of network communication, it also introduces challenges related to error handling, coupling, and scalability. Modern implementations like gRPC have addressed many of these challenges, making RPC a viable option for high-performance, cross-language services.

<details><summary style="font-size:30px;color:Orange">SOAP</summary>

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. It uses XML for its message format and relies on application layer protocols, most commonly HTTP or SMTP, for message negotiation and transmission.

#### Key Characteristics of SOAP

1. **Protocol-Based Communication**: SOAP defines a standard protocol specification for exchanging structured information between web services. It is protocol-agnostic, meaning it can work over any transport protocol such as HTTP, SMTP, TCP, etc.
2. **XML-Based Messaging**: SOAP messages are encoded in XML, making them platform-independent and ensuring that they can be read and understood by any system that understands XML. A typical SOAP message includes an envelope, a header, and a body.
3. **Strict Standards and Specifications**: SOAP follows strict standards defined by the W3C, ensuring a high level of interoperability between different systems and programming languages. It includes standards for security (WS-Security), transactions (WS-AtomicTransaction), and more.
4. **Built-in Error Handling**: SOAP has built-in error handling through its fault elements, allowing for detailed error reporting and handling mechanisms in the communication process.
5. **Extensibility**: SOAP's XML-based protocol can be extended to support different message exchange patterns, such as request/response, one-way messages, and more complex interactions.

#### Components of SOAP

1. **SOAP Envelope:**

    - The envelope is the root element of a SOAP message and defines the start and end of the message. It contains a header and a body.
    - Example:
        ```xml
        <soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope">
          <soap:Header>
            <!-- Optional headers go here -->
          </soap:Header>
          <soap:Body>
            <!-- Body containing the actual message -->
          </soap:Body>
        </soap:Envelope>
        ```

2. **SOAP Header:**

    - The header is an optional element that contains application-specific information (like security credentials or transaction IDs) about the SOAP message.
    - Example:
        ```xml
        <soap:Header>
          <authToken>12345</authToken>
        </soap:Header>
        ```

3. **SOAP Body:**

    - The body is a mandatory element that contains the actual message intended for the recipient. It can include request or response data.
    - Example:
        ```xml
        <soap:Body>
          <m:GetBookDetails xmlns:m="http://example.org/book">
            <m:ISBN>1234567890</m:ISBN>
          </m:GetBookDetails>
        </soap:Body>
        ```

4. **SOAP Fault:**
    - The fault element is used for error handling and appears within the body of the SOAP message if there is an error in processing the message.
    - Example:
        ```xml
        <soap:Body>
          <soap:Fault>
            <faultcode>soap:Client</faultcode>
            <faultstring>Invalid ISBN</faultstring>
          </soap:Fault>
        </soap:Body>
        ```

#### Summary

SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services. It uses XML for message formatting and relies on a variety of network protocols, such as HTTP or SMTP, for message negotiation and transmission.

-   **Key Points**:

    -   1. **XML-Based:** Messages are formatted in XML, making them platform-independent.
    -   2. **Protocol-Agnostic:** Can work over different network protocols (e.g., HTTP, SMTP).
    -   3. **Structured Format:** Consists of an envelope, header, body, and fault elements for errors.
    -   4. **Standardized:** Follows W3C standards for high interoperability.
    -   5. **Error Handling:** Built-in mechanisms for error reporting.

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol used in API design to facilitate the exchange of structured information in web services. It employs XML for message formatting, follows strict standards for interoperability, and includes built-in mechanisms for extensibility and error handling. SOAP can operate over various transport protocols and is known for its robustness and ability to work in diverse and complex enterprise environments.

<details><summary style="font-size:30px;color:Orange">APPlication Design Architectures</summary>

<details><summary style="font-size:22px;color:Tomato">Monolithic Architecture</summary>

**Monolithic Architecture** is a software design approach where an application is built as a single, unified unit. All components, such as the user interface, business logic, and data access, are tightly integrated and operate together in one codebase and deployment package.

A **Monolithic Architecture** refers to an application that is built as a single, indivisible unit. All components of the application, such as the user interface (UI), business logic, and database access, are packaged and deployed together.

#### Characteristics:

-   **Single Codebase**: All the functionality resides in a single codebase and is deployed as one cohesive unit.
-   **Tight Coupling**: Different components (UI, logic, database, etc.) are tightly coupled.
-   **Single Deployment**: You deploy the entire application as one package. Any change requires redeploying the whole system.
-   **Shared Database**: Typically, a monolithic system uses a single, shared database.

#### Advantages:

-   **Simplicity**: Easy to develop and deploy as it’s a single unit.
-   **Performance**: Monolithic systems can perform well because everything runs in the same process.
-   **Fewer Cross-cutting Concerns**: Tools and libraries for security, logging, etc., can be easily integrated since there’s one shared codebase.

#### Disadvantages:

-   **Scalability**: Scaling a monolithic application means scaling the entire application, even if only a small part of the system needs more resources.
-   **Limited Flexibility**: Changes in one part of the system can affect other parts, making it difficult to modify or update features.
-   **Slow Development and Deployment**: As the system grows, building, testing, and deploying the application becomes more complex and time-consuming.

#### Use Cases:

-   Suitable for small applications with limited complexity.
-   Early stages of startups or applications with well-defined, simple features.

<details><summary style="font-size:22px;color:Tomato">Multi-Tier Architecture</summary>

**Multi-tier Architecture** (also called N-tier Architecture) is a software design approach where an application is divided into separate layers (tiers), each responsible for a specific function. The most common tiers are the `presentation layer` (UI), the `application logic layer` (business logic), and the `data layer` (database). These tiers are physically or logically separated and communicate with each other.

In **Multi-tier Architecture** (or **N-tier Architecture**), the application is divided into several distinct layers (tiers), each responsible for a specific function. The separation of concerns between these layers enhances maintainability, scalability, and flexibility. Here are the main and critical components of multi-tier architecture:

#### Components of Multi-tier Architecture

1. **Presentation Tier (UI Layer)**

    - This is the topmost layer responsible for interacting with users.
    - Displays data to users and collects input through graphical interfaces (web, desktop, or mobile UI).

2. **Application Tier (Logic/Business Layer)**

    - Contains the core business logic that processes requests, enforces rules, and performs computations.
    - Acts as the middle layer that handles operations requested by the presentation tier and accesses data from the data tier.

3. **Data Tier (Database Layer)**
    - Manages data storage, retrieval, and updates.
    - Handles interactions with the database, ensuring that data is stored and retrieved efficiently and securely.

#### Characteristics:

-   **Layered Approach**: Each tier is physically or logically separated. Typical layers are the user interface, business logic, and data management.
-   **Modular**: Each tier performs a specific function, allowing for better separation of concerns.
-   **Client-Server Model**: Usually follows a client-server architecture where the client handles the presentation and interacts with the application server (which handles logic) and the database server (which handles data storage).

#### Typical Layers:

1. **Presentation Tier**: This is the user interface layer where users interact with the application. It sends user requests to the logic tier and presents the response.
2. **Application Tier**: This layer contains the business logic of the application. It processes the data and enforces rules.
3. **Data Tier**: This tier manages the data storage, usually in a database. It retrieves, stores, and updates the data as requested by the application tier.

#### Advantages:

-   **Separation of Concerns**: Each tier focuses on its specific responsibility, making the system more maintainable and easier to manage.
-   **Scalability**: Each tier can be scaled independently based on its load. For example, the database layer can be scaled separately from the logic layer.
-   **Maintainability**: It is easier to maintain and update individual tiers without affecting others.

#### Disadvantages:

-   **Performance Overhead**: Communication between tiers can introduce latency, making the system slower compared to monolithic architecture.
-   **Complexity**: More moving parts (servers, connections, etc.) can increase the complexity of the system.
-   **Deployment Complexity**: Managing the deployment of multiple layers requires more planning and resources.

#### Use Cases:

-   Web applications that require a clear separation of concerns.
-   Enterprise-level applications where scalability and maintainability are important.

<details><summary style="font-size:22px;color:Tomato">Microservices Architecture</summary>

**Microservice Architecture** is a software design approach where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services, each responsible for a specific business function. These services operate autonomously, communicate through APIs (such as REST or messaging), and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of one another. This architecture promotes flexibility, scalability, and fault isolation.

In **Microservices Architecture**, the application is divided into small, independent services, each responsible for a specific business capability. Each microservice operates as a separate process, and they communicate with each other via well-defined APIs (such as REST or messaging queues).

#### Components of Microservice Architecture:

1. **Services**:

    - **Independent Modules**: Each microservice is a self-contained, independent module responsible for a specific business function (e.g., user management, payment processing).
    - **Autonomous Deployment**: Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

2. **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for clients to interact with various microservices. It handles routing, request aggregation, and can enforce security, rate limiting, and authentication.

3. **Service Discovery**: A mechanism that allows microservices to find each other dynamically within the system, usually through a registry (e.g., Eureka, Consul). This ensures flexibility in scaling and changing services.

4. **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming requests across multiple instances of services to ensure even workload distribution and high availability.

5. **Database Per Service**: Each microservice has its own dedicated database, ensuring data autonomy and avoiding direct data sharing between services.

6. **Inter-Service Communication**: Microservices communicate with each other, usually via lightweight protocols such as HTTP/REST, gRPC, or messaging queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous communication.

7. **Centralized Configuration Management**: A system that manages configurations for microservices across environments (development, production) without embedding them in the services (e.g., Spring Cloud Config).

8. **Logging and Monitoring**: Centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack) and monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track service performance, detect failures, and analyze system health.

9. **Containerization & Orchestration**: **Containers** (e.g., Docker) package microservices, and **orchestration tools** (e.g., Kubernetes) manage the deployment, scaling, and operation of these containers in a distributed environment.

10. **Fault Tolerance**: Mechanisms like **circuit breakers** (e.g., Hystrix) and **retries** help maintain stability by isolating failing services and preventing cascading failures.

#### Characteristics:

-   **Loose Coupling**: Microservices are loosely coupled. Each service is independent of others, making the system highly modular.
-   **Autonomous Deployment**: Each microservice can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
-   **Technology Agnostic**: Each service can use different technologies, programming languages, and databases based on its needs.
-   **Service Isolation**: Each microservice has its own data store, so there's no need for a shared database.

#### Advantages:

-   **Scalability**: You can scale individual services as needed, improving resource efficiency.
-   **Flexibility**: Developers can choose different tools or languages for each service based on specific requirements.
-   **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one microservice typically doesn’t bring down the entire system. Other services can continue running.
-   **Agility**: Independent development and deployment of services enable faster iterations and continuous delivery.

#### Disadvantages:

-   **Complexity**: Managing multiple services, each with its own database and deployment, adds significant operational complexity.
-   **Distributed Systems Issues**: Communication between services introduces challenges like network latency, load balancing, and fault tolerance.
-   **Data Consistency**: Since each microservice manages its own database, ensuring consistency across services can be difficult.
-   **Deployment Overhead**: Managing and deploying multiple microservices requires sophisticated DevOps practices like containerization, orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), and automated CI/CD pipelines.

#### Use Cases:

-   Large, complex applications that require scalability, flexibility, and frequent updates.
-   Organizations adopting continuous deployment practices and want the flexibility to update or change parts of the application independently.

<details><summary style="font-size:30px;color:Orange">Security Measures & Vulnerabilitis</summary>

-   [Ethical Hacking 101: Web App Penetration Testing - a full course for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_lswM1S264)

#### What is CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)?

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker tricks a user's browser into making an unwanted request to a web application where the user is authenticated. This attack takes advantage of the fact that web browsers automatically include all relevant cookies for a specific domain in every HTTP request sent to that domain.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how a CSRF attack works:

-   `Authentication`: The victim logs into a web application, and the application issues a session cookie to the user to keep them authenticated.

-   `Attacker's Preparation`: The attacker creates a malicious webpage or embeds malicious code into a website that the victim visits.

-   `Unwanted Request`: When the victim visits the attacker's webpage or the compromised site, the malicious code on the page triggers a request to the vulnerable web application where the victim is authenticated.

-   `Automatic Inclusion of Cookies`: Because the victim is already authenticated with the web application, the victim's browser automatically includes the authentication cookies in the request.

-   `Execution of Unwanted Action`: The web application, unaware that the request did not originate from the legitimate user, processes the request as if it were a legitimate action initiated by the user.

CSRF attacks are particularly dangerous when they involve actions that cause state changes on the server, such as changing a user's password, transferring funds, or making a purchase.

To protect against CSRF attacks, web applications can implement measures like:

-   `Anti-CSRF Tokens`: Include a unique, random token in each form or request that modifies server state. The token is verified on the server side to ensure that the request is legitimate.

-   `SameSite Cookie Attribute`: Set the SameSite attribute on cookies to 'Strict' or 'Lax'. This restricts how cookies are sent with cross-site requests, mitigating the risk of CSRF.

-   `Referrer Policy`: Set an appropriate Referrer Policy to control which information is included in the Referer header. This helps prevent certain types of CSRF attacks.

-   `Use of HTTP Methods`: Ensure that state-changing requests use HTTP methods that have side-effect semantics (such as POST or DELETE) rather than safe methods like GET.

In Flask, you can use the flask-wtf extension, along with its CSRF protection features, to guard against CSRF attacks. Here's a simple example:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import StringField

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'  # Replace with a strong, secret key

class MyForm(FlaskForm):
    username = StringField('Username')

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    form = MyForm()

    if form.validate_on_submit():
        # Process the form data securely
        return f'Hello, {form.username.data}!'

    return render_template('index.html', form=form)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, the FlaskForm from flask-wtf automatically includes a CSRF token in the form, providing protection against CSRF attacks when submitting the form.

#### What is CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)?

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by web browsers that controls how web pages from one domain can request and interact with resources from another domain. The Same-Origin Policy (SOP) is a security measure that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. CORS is a mechanism to relax this restriction selectively.

When a web page hosted on one domain makes an HTTP request to a different domain, the browser, by default, blocks the request due to the Same-Origin Policy. CORS allows servers to specify which origins are permitted to access their resources, and which HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT) and headers can be used in cross-origin requests.

Here's how CORS works:

-   `Browser Pre-flight Request`: Before making certain types of cross-origin requests, the browser may send a pre-flight request (using the HTTP OPTIONS method) to the target server. This pre-flight request includes information about the actual request, such as the HTTP method and headers.

-   `Server Response Headers`: The server responds to the pre-flight request with specific HTTP headers that indicate which origins are allowed, which methods are permitted, and which headers can be included in the actual request.

-   `Actual Request`: If the server's response headers permit the cross-origin request, the browser proceeds with the actual request. Otherwise, the browser blocks the request.

In a Flask application, you may encounter CORS-related issues if your frontend code (hosted on a different domain) tries to make requests to your Flask API. To handle CORS in a Flask application, you can use the flask-cors extension, which simplifies the process of adding the necessary headers to responses.

Here's an example of how to use flask-cors to enable CORS in a Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

@app.route('/api/data', methods=['GET'])
def get_data():
    data = {'message': 'This is a sample API response.'}
    return jsonify(data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, the CORS(app) line adds the necessary headers to responses to allow cross-origin requests from any origin. You can also customize CORS settings based on your specific requirements.

Keep in mind that enabling CORS should be done carefully, and it's important to specify only the origins, methods, and headers that are necessary for your application's functionality to avoid potential security risks.

#### What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?

-   `Autoescaping`: Autoescaping is the concept of automatically escaping special characters for you. Special characters in the sense of HTML (or XML, and thus XHTML) are &, >, <, " as well as '. Because these characters carry specific meanings in documents on their own you have to replace them by so called “entities” if you want to use them for text. Not doing so would not only cause user frustration by the inability to use these characters in text, but can also lead to security problems.
-   [Flask: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/security/#security-xss)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. The primary goal of XSS attacks is to execute scripts in the context of a user's browser, enabling the attacker to steal sensitive information, manipulate page content, or perform actions on behalf of the victim.

There are three main types of XSS attacks:

-   `Stored XSS (Persistent XSS)`: In a stored XSS attack, the malicious script is permanently stored on the target server and served to users when they access a particular page. This could happen, for example, if an attacker injects malicious code into a forum post, comment, or user profile.

-   `Reflected XSS (Non-Persistent XSS)`: In a reflected XSS attack, the malicious script is embedded in a URL, a form input, or another input field. When the victim clicks on a manipulated link or submits a form, the script is included in the server's response and executed in the victim's browser.

-   `DOM-based XSS`: DOM-based XSS occurs when the client-side script manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page. This can happen when the application processes user input to dynamically update the DOM without properly validating or sanitizing the input.

Here's a simple example of a reflected XSS attack:

```html
<!-- Malicious URL -->
https://example.com/search?query=
<script>
    alert("XSS");
</script>

<!-- Rendered HTML in the victim's browser -->
<p>
    Search results for:
    <script>
        alert("XSS");
    </script>
</p>
```

In this example, an attacker includes a script in the query parameter of a URL. If a user clicks on this link, the script is executed in the context of the victim's browser, leading to an alert box with the message 'XSS'.

To prevent XSS attacks, web developers should adopt secure coding practices:

-   `Input Validation`: Validate and sanitize all user inputs on the server side to ensure they do not contain malicious scripts. Use libraries or frameworks that automatically escape or sanitize input data.

-   `Output Encoding`: Encode data appropriately before rendering it in HTML, JavaScript, or other contexts to prevent the execution of scripts. This can be achieved using functions such as htmlspecialchars in PHP or libraries like Jinja in Python.

-   `Content Security Policy (CSP)`: Implement Content Security Policy headers to restrict the types of content that can be executed on a web page. CSP allows developers to define a whitelist of trusted sources for scripts, styles, and other resources.

-   `HTTP-Only Cookies`: Set the HTTP-Only flag on cookies to prevent them from being accessed by client-side scripts, reducing the risk of cookie theft in case of an XSS attack.

-   `Secure Coding Practices`: Follow secure coding practices and conduct regular security audits to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in the application code.

By incorporating these practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk of XSS vulnerabilities and enhance the security of their web applications.

#### What is SQL Injection?

SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate an application's SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code. This is a serious security issue because it allows unauthorized access, manipulation, or deletion of data in a database.

In the context of a Python Flask application, SQL injection can occur if the application constructs SQL queries using user-supplied input without properly validating or sanitizing that input. Flask applications often use an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system like SQLAlchemy, which helps prevent SQL injection by automatically parameterizing SQL queries.

Here's an example of how SQL injection might occur in a Flask application if not properly handled:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///example.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable=False)

@app.route('/login')
def login():
    username = request.args.get('username')
    password = request.args.get('password')

    # Vulnerable to SQL injection
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username, password=password).first()

    if user:
        return 'Login successful'
    else:
        return 'Login failed'
```

In the above example, the login route takes username and password parameters from the request's query string and uses them directly in the SQL query. An attacker could manipulate the values of these parameters to inject malicious SQL code, potentially bypassing authentication.

To prevent SQL injection in Flask applications, it's crucial to use parameterized queries provided by the ORM or to employ safe query-building practices. Here's an improved version of the above example using SQLAlchemy parameterized queries:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy.sql import text

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///example.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable=False)

@app.route('/login')
def login():
    username = request.args.get('username')
    password = request.args.get('password')

    # Using parameterized query to prevent SQL injection
    query = text("SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = :username AND password = :password")
    user = db.engine.execute(query, {'username': username, 'password': password}).first()

    if user:
        return 'Login successful'
    else:
        return 'Login failed'
```

In this improved version, the query is constructed using the text function, and placeholders :username and :password are used. The actual values are provided separately, preventing SQL injection attacks. Always follow secure coding practices to mitigate security vulnerabilities like SQL injection in your Flask applications.

#### OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit organization focused on improving the security of software. OWASP provides resources, tools, and guidelines to help organizations develop and maintain secure web applications and APIs. API security is a critical aspect of overall web application security, and OWASP has outlined key recommendations and best practices for securing APIs.

-   `Gunicorn` vs `uWSGI` vs `Uvicorn`: `Gunicorn`, `uWSGI` and `Uvicorn` are popular Python WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) servers that are commonly used to serve Python web applications.
    -   **Gunicorn** (short for Green Unicorn) is a Python WSGI HTTP server that is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to use. It can handle multiple requests concurrently and can scale to handle large numbers of requests. `Gunicorn` is commonly used in conjunction with a reverse proxy server, such as `Nginx` or `Apache`, which handles incoming requests and passes them on to `Gunicorn`.
    -   **uWSGI** is a more feature-rich WSGI server that is designed to be highly configurable and extensible. It supports multiple protocols and interfaces, including WSGI, FastCGI, and HTTP. `uWSGI` is known for its ability to handle high traffic volumes and its support for a variety of advanced features, including load balancing, caching, and process management.
    -   **Uvicorn**: Uvicorn is an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server that is used to run asynchronous web applications written in Python. ASGI is a specification for asynchronous web servers and applications, allowing for better support of long-lived connections and real-time communication.
-   `Apache` is a popular web server that has been around for a long time. It is widely used and supports a wide range of features and modules, making it highly configurable and adaptable to different use cases. `Apache` is primarily used for serving static content and dynamic content through the use of modules such as PHP or Python.
-   `Nginx` is a newer web server that has gained popularity in recent years due to its high performance and scalability. `Nginx` is designed to handle large volumes of traffic and can serve both static and dynamic content. `Nginx` is often used as a **reverse proxy** in front of other web servers, such as `Apache` or `Tomcat`, to improve performance and reliability.
-   `Tomcat` is a Java-based web server and application server that is designed to serve Java applications. It supports the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) specifications and is often used to serve Java web applications. `Tomcat` is highly configurable and can be extended through the use of plugins and modules.

#### `Proxy Server` vs `Reverse Proxy Server`:

-   `Proxy Server`: A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client and a server. When a client makes a request to access a resource (e.g., a web page), the request is first sent to the proxy server. The proxy server then forwards the request to the destination server on behalf of the client. The response from the server is relayed back to the client through the proxy server. A proxy server can reside in various locations within a network architecture, depending on its intended purpose and the network's configuration; for example, On-Premises Network, Data Center, Cloud Environment, Content Delevary Networks (CDNs) etc. The key characteristics of a proxy server include:

    -   `Client-side configuration`: The client needs to be aware of and configured to use the proxy server.
    -   `Client anonymity`: The server sees the proxy server's IP address instead of the client's IP address.
    -   `Caching`: Proxy servers can cache responses, allowing subsequent requests for the same resource to be served directly from the cache instead of going to the server again.
    -   Proxy servers are often used for purposes such as improving performance through caching, controlling access to resources (e.g., content filtering, firewall), and providing anonymity for clients.

-   `Reverse Proxy Server`: A reverse proxy server is similar to a proxy server but operates on the server-side instead of the client-side. It sits between the client and the destination server and forwards client requests to the appropriate backend servers based on various criteria (e.g., load balancing, request routing, SSL termination). The client is unaware of the presence of the reverse proxy and communicates directly with it. The key characteristics of a reverse proxy server include:

    -   `Server-side configuration`: The server is configured to use the reverse proxy to handle incoming requests.
    -   `Load balancing`: Reverse proxies distribute client requests across multiple backend servers to balance the load.
    -   `SSL termination`: Reverse proxies can handle SSL encryption/decryption, offloading this task from backend servers.
    -   `Caching`: Reverse proxies can also cache responses to improve performance.
    -   Reverse proxy servers are commonly used for load balancing, high availability, SSL termination, request routing, and as a security layer protecting backend servers by shielding them from direct access.

-   The image below show how 'client', 'Nginx', and 'uWSGI' work together.

    -   ![server configuration for Django](/assets/django/nginx-uwsgi.webp)

#### `Reverse Proxy Server` vs `Web Server Gateway Interface` (WSGI):

A Reverse Proxy Server and a Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) serve different roles in web application architecture, but they are complementary components. Here's a comparison of the two:

-   `Reverse Proxy Server`: A reverse proxy server is a server that sits between client devices and backend web servers. It receives incoming client requests, such as HTTP requests, and forwards those requests to the appropriate backend server or application.

    -   `Purpose`:

        -   `Load Balancing`: Reverse proxies can distribute client requests across multiple backend servers to balance the load and improve performance and reliability.
        -   `Security`: They can provide an additional layer of security by hiding the internal structure of the network and filtering out malicious traffic.
        -   `SSL Termination`: Reverse proxies can handle SSL/TLS encryption and decryption, offloading this resource-intensive task from the backend servers.
        -   `Caching`: They can cache frequently requested content to reduce the load on backend servers and improve response times.

    -   `Examples`: `Nginx` and `Apache` HTTP Server are commonly used as reverse proxy servers. CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) often use reverse proxies to cache and serve static content.

-   `Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI)`: WSGI is a specification in Python that defines a standard interface between web servers and web applications or frameworks. It allows web servers to communicate with Python web applications in a consistent and standardized way.

    -   `Purpose`:

        -   WSGI serves as an interface between a web server and a Python web application or framework.
        -   It allows different web servers to run Python web applications written using various frameworks, such as Flask, Django, or Pyramid.

    -   `Examples`: Popular Python web servers like `Gunicorn`, `uWSGI`, and `mod_wsgi` (for Apache) implement the WSGI standard. Python web frameworks, including Flask and Django, can be deployed using WSGI servers.

-   `Relationship`:

    -   `A reverse proxy server and WSGI serve different but complementary roles`:

        -   The reverse proxy server handles tasks like load balancing, SSL termination, and security at the network level, sitting between clients and backend servers.
        -   WSGI, on the other hand, handles the communication between a web server and a Python web application at the application level, allowing the Python code to receive and process HTTP requests.

    -   In a typical web application architecture, a reverse proxy server (e.g., Nginx) may be used to handle tasks like load balancing and SSL termination, while a WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn or uWSGI) interfaces with the Python web application to serve dynamic content.

In summary, a reverse proxy server and WSGI serve different purposes in web application architecture. The reverse proxy manages network-level tasks, while WSGI provides a standardized interface for communication between web servers and Python web applications. Together, they enable the deployment of Python web applications in a scalable and secure manner.

#### ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface):

ASGI is a specification for asynchronous web servers and frameworks in Python. It allows Python web applications to handle asynchronous operations, such as long-lived connections and real-time communication, in an efficient and non-blocking manner.

ASGI servers are the web servers that implement the ASGI specification. These servers are responsible for handling incoming ASGI requests and routing them to the appropriate ASGI application or framework. Some popular ASGI servers include Daphne, Uvicorn, Hypercorn, and more. Uvicorn, for example, is widely used and known for its simplicity and performance.

-   `Purpose`:

    -   ASGI is designed to handle asynchronous web applications and services that require real-time interactions, like chat applications, streaming, and server-sent events.
    -   It provides a standardized interface for handling asynchronous HTTP requests and WebSocket connections.

-   `Usage`:

    -   ASGI servers are commonly used with asynchronous web frameworks like FastAPI and Starlette to build high-performance web applications that require real-time capabilities.
    -   To run an ASGI application with a server like Uvicorn, you typically use a command like this:

        -   `$ uvicorn core.wsgi:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
        -   In this example, `wsgi` is the Python module in `core` directory which containing your ASGI application instance assigned to `app` variable (`app` is the instance of your ASGI application within that module).

-   [https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/settings.html](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/settings.html)
-   `gunicorn.socket` vs `gunicorn.service`: these are systemd units used for running Gunicorn, a Python WSGI HTTP server. They serve different purposes within the systemd service management system.

    -   `gunicorn.socket`: This file represents a Socket Unit which nanage inter-process communication through sockets. It defines a system socket that listens for incoming connections and passes them to the associated service unit (`gunicorn.service`). The `gunicorn.socket` unit allows systemd to manage the socket activation process, where the socket is created on-demand when a connection is received. This helps improve resource usage by only starting the Gunicorn process when needed.
    -   `gunicorn.service`: This file represents a Service Unit. It defines the Gunicorn service that handles the incoming connections received through the associated socket (`gunicorn.socket`). The `gunicorn.service` unit specifies the command to start the Gunicorn process, along with its configuration options and other settings.

-   `$ gunicorn core.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000`
    -   specifies the network address and port to bind the server to:
        -   `0.0.0.0` means the server will listen on all available network interfaces, making it accessible from any host.
        -   `8000` is the port number the server will listen on.
-   `$ gunicorn core.wsgi:application --config ./gunicorn_config.py`

<details><summary style="font-size:18px;color:Orange;text-align:left">uWSGI</summary>

-   [uWSGI (universal Web Server Gateway Interface)](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html): It's a popular web server interface and application server gateway that facilitates communication between web servers and web applications, allowing them to work together seamlessly. uWSGI is commonly used in deploying Python web applications, but it supports multiple programming languages and frameworks.

-   What is `uwsgi_params` file?

    -   The `uwsgi_params` file is a configuration file used by uWSGI, which is a fast and flexible application server commonly used for hosting Python web applications. The `uwsgi_params` file contains a set of predefined variables and configurations that are used to communicate between the web server (such as Nginx) and the uWSGI application server.
    -   The contents of the `uwsgi_params` file typically include directives that define how certain aspects of the communication between Nginx and uWSGI should be handled. These directives often include settings related to request buffering, proxying, and headers.
    -   Some common directives found in the `uwsgi_params` file include:

        -   `uwsgi_param QUERY_STRING $query_string;`

            -   This directive sets the value of the QUERY_STRING variable to the value of the query string provided in the original HTTP request.

        -   `uwsgi_param REQUEST_METHOD $request_method;`

            -   This directive sets the value of the REQUEST_METHOD variable to the HTTP request method (e.g., GET, POST, etc.).

        -   `uwsgi_param CONTENT_TYPE $content_type;`

            -   This directive sets the value of the CONTENT_TYPE variable to the type of the content being sent in the request, such as "application/json" or "text/html".

        -   `uwsgi_param CONTENT_LENGTH $content_length;`
            -   This directive sets the value of the CONTENT_LENGTH variable to the size of the content being sent in the request.

    -   These directives are used to pass information from Nginx to the uWSGI application server, enabling proper handling of requests and responses.
    -   The `uwsgi_params` file is typically included in the Nginx configuration when using uWSGI as the application server. It ensures that the necessary variables and configurations are available for the communication between Nginx and uWSGI to work correctly.
    -   It's important to note that the specific contents of the `uwsgi_params` file can vary depending on the configuration and requirements of your specific application or environment.

#### Terms and Concepts

-   `nginx.conf`: The nginx configuration file, typically named `nginx.conf`, is a text-based file that specifies how the Nginx web server should behave. The `nginx.conf` file is written in a language called NGINX configuration language or NGINX Configuration Syntax. It is a custom configuration syntax specific to NGINX. It contains a set of directives within different contexts to specify their scope and define various aspects of server functionality, such as server listening ports, request handling, load balancing, caching, and security settings. The main contexts in an `nginx.conf` file are:

-   `default.conf.tpl`: It is a template file for a server block configuration in Nginx. A server block (also known as a virtual host) is a configuration that defines how Nginx should handle requests for a specific domain or IP address. The ".tpl" extension suggests that this file is a template that can be used to generate an actual default.conf file. Typically, you would have multiple `*.conf.tpl` files, each representing a different virtual host configuration template.

-   `Main Context`: The main context includes directives that apply globally to the entire Nginx server. It is typically defined within the http block. Directives within this context affect the overall behavior of the server, such as the number of worker processes, the user and group that the server runs as, and the configuration for logging. It typically contains directives such as server, upstream, and include.

    -   ![Main Context](/assets/nginx/main-context.png)

-   `Events Context`: The events context, also defined within the http block, is used to configure how Nginx handles connections and events. Directives in this context control parameters such as the maximum number of connections, the worker connections, and the multi_accept setting.

-   `HTTP Context`: The HTTP context contains server-level configurations and is defined within the http block. It includes directives related to HTTP protocol settings, server-wide proxies, gzip compression, SSL/TLS settings, and default MIME types. Server blocks (virtual servers) are typically defined within the HTTP context.

-   `Server Context`: The server context defines the configuration for a specific virtual server (server block). It is contained within the http context and includes directives that apply to a particular server or group of servers. Directives within the server context may include the server name, listening ports, SSL/TLS configurations, proxy settings, and location blocks.

-   `Location Context`: The location context is defined within a server context and is used to configure how Nginx handles specific URL patterns or paths. Directives within the location context determine how requests matching the specified pattern are processed. Examples of directives within the location context are root, try_files, proxy_pass, rewrite, and access control directives such as allow and deny.

-   `Directive`: A directive is a command that configures a specific aspect of the server's behavior. Each directive is placed within the appropriate context to ensure it is applied at the desired level, whether it is server-wide, specific to a virtual server, or for handling requests matching a particular URL pattern. The context hierarchy and directive placement allow for fine-grained control over the server's behavior and functionality. It's important to note that the structure and directives in the `nginx.conf` file may vary depending on the specific setup and requirements of your web server. Understanding the purpose and proper usage of each directive is essential for configuring Nginx to meet your application's needs. Examples of commonly used directives are:

    -   ![Directives](/assets/nginx/directives.png)

    -   `listen`: Specifies the IP address and port on which Nginx should listen for incoming requests.
    -   `server_name`: Defines the domain name(s) associated with the server block.
    -   `root`: Specifies the document root directory where static files are located.
    -   `proxy_pass`: Forwards requests to a specified backend server.
    -   `try_files`: Defines the fallback behavior for file requests that do not exist.
    -   `ssl_certificate and ssl_certificate_key`: Configures SSL/TLS certificates for secure connections.
    -   `gzip`: Enables compression of HTTP responses to reduce file size.
    -   `access_log and error_log`: Specifies the log file locations for access and error logging.

-   `Block` vs `Context`: In Nginx configuration files, the terms "block" and "context" are often used interchangeably to refer to a section of directives that serve a specific purpose. The distinction between blocks and contexts can be a bit nuanced, but in general, blocks refer to the specific groups of directives enclosed within curly braces, while contexts refer to the overall hierarchical structure and scope of the configuration file.

-   `Block`: A block in Nginx refers to a group of directives enclosed within curly braces {}. Blocks define the scope and boundaries of a configuration section and determine where directives are applicable. There are several types of blocks in an nginx.conf file:

-   `Include Directive`: The include directive in Nginx is used to include external configuration files within the main `nginx.conf` file. It allows you to split your configuration into multiple files for better organization and easier maintenance. Using the include directive can help simplify the management of complex configurations by dividing them into smaller, modular files. It allows you to reuse common configurations across multiple server blocks, separate different aspects of the configuration, and make it easier to maintain and update your Nginx setup. Here's how the include directive works:

    -   `Syntax`: The include directive is written as follows:

        ```txt
        include file_path;
        ```

        -   `file_path` represents the path to the external configuration file you want to include. It can be an absolute path or a relative path to the nginx.conf file.

    -   `Usage`: The include directive can be used in various contexts within the nginx.conf file. For example:

        -   `Global context`: It can be placed in the main http block of the nginx.conf file to include global configurations that apply to the entire server.
        -   `Server context`: It can be placed within individual server blocks to include server-specific configurations.
        -   `Location context`: It can be placed within location blocks to include specific configuration snippets related to handling requests for specific URL patterns.

    -   `Multiple Includes`: You can use multiple include directives to include multiple configuration files. They can be specified in the same context or in different contexts, depending on where you want the configurations to apply. For example:

        ```txt
        include /path/to/file1.conf;
        include /path/to/file2.conf;
        ```

    -   `Wildcard Includes`: The include directive also supports wildcard patterns (_) to include multiple files that match a specific pattern. For example, you can use include /path/to/_.conf; to include all configuration files with the .conf extension in the specified directory.

#### Basic Nignx Commands

-   `$ nginx -v` → Check Nginx version
-   `$ sudo nginx -t` → Check configuration file syntex before reloading
-   `$ nginx -T` → Display current configuration
-   `$ nginx -s reload` → Reload Nginx

#### Configuration file

-   `/ect/nginx/nginx.conf` → Main file location of Nginx
-   `/ect/nginx/conf.d/*.conf` → Include file location of Nginx

<details><summary style="font-size:30px;color:Orange">SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)</summary>

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured framework that outlines the phases and processes involved in the development of software applications or systems. It provides a systematic approach to software development, from the initial concept to maintenance and eventual retirement of the software. Let's explore the SDLC in detail:

1. `Planning Phase`:

    - `Project Initiation`: This phase begins with the identification of a need or an opportunity for a software solution. It involves creating a project proposal, defining goals, and determining the project's feasibility.
    - `Requirements Gathering`: During this stage, project stakeholders, including end-users and clients, collaborate with the development team to collect and document detailed requirements for the software.

1. `Feasibility Study`:

    - An evaluation is performed to determine the technical, operational, and economic feasibility of the project. This assessment helps in deciding whether to proceed with the project.

1. `Design Phase`:

    - `System Design`: This involves creating a high-level design of the system, including architecture, data structures, and the overall system structure.
    - `Detailed Design`: In this stage, the high-level design is further refined, specifying data formats, algorithms, and interfaces in greater detail.

1. `Implementation (Coding) Phase`:

    - Developers write the code according to the detailed design specifications. They follow coding standards and best practices to ensure the code is maintainable and efficient.
    - Unit testing is conducted during this phase to ensure individual components work correctly.

1. `Testing Phase`:

    - `Unit Testing`: Developers test individual modules or components to verify their correctness.
    - `Integration Testing`: The different modules or components are integrated, and testing is performed to identify any issues in their interactions.
    - `System Testing`: The entire system is tested to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
    - `User Acceptance Testing (UAT)`: End-users or clients perform testing to validate that the software meets their expectations.

1. `Deployment Phase`:

    - The software is deployed to the production environment, making it accessible to end-users.
    - This may involve data migration, configuration, and setting up the necessary infrastructure.

1. `Maintenance and Support Phase`:

    - After deployment, ongoing maintenance, support, and updates are provided to address issues, enhance functionality, and ensure the software remains reliable and secure.

1. `Evaluation Phase`:

    - At various points in the SDLC, the project is evaluated to ensure it aligns with its initial goals, meets quality standards, and remains on schedule and within budget.

<details><summary style="font-size:30px;color:Orange">Software Development Methodology</summary>

Software Development Approaches also known as software development methodologies or models, define the overall process and structure for developing software applications. Different approaches have evolved over time to address various project requirements, team dynamics, and development challenges. Here are some commonly used software development approaches:

Agile, Scrum, and Kanban are all software development methodologies, but they have different approaches and are best suited for different types of projects and teams. Let's compare these methodologies:

1. `Agile Methodology`:

    - `Overview`: Agile is a broad and flexible approach to software development that emphasizes iterative, customer-centric, and collaborative development.
    - `Key Principles`: Customer collaboration, responding to change, delivering working software, and individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
    - `Project Management`: Agile doesn't prescribe specific roles or processes but encourages self-organizing teams to choose their own methods.
    - `Iterations`: Agile work is organized into short iterations or sprints, which typically last 2-4 weeks.
    - `Adaptability`: Agile is highly adaptable to changing requirements and is suitable for projects with evolving or uncertain needs.

2. `Scrum Methodology`:

    - `Overview`: Scrum is a specific framework within the Agile methodology, focusing on team collaboration, product backlog, and time-boxed sprints.
    - `Roles: Scrum defines specific roles`: Product Owner (managing the product backlog), Scrum Master (facilitating the team), and Development Team.
    - `Artifacts`: Scrum uses artifacts like the Product Backlog (list of requirements), Sprint Backlog (list of tasks for a sprint), and the Increment (the potentially shippable product at the end of each sprint).
    - `Events`: Scrum prescribes specific events, such as Sprint Planning, Daily Standup, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.
    - `Advantages`: Clear roles and responsibilities, transparency, regular inspection, and adaptation.
    - `Disadvantages`: May not fit all project types, can be challenging to implement if the team isn't self-organizing.

3. `Kanban Methodology`:

    - `Overview`: Kanban is a visual approach to managing work and emphasizes a pull system with continuous delivery.
    - `Principles`: Kanban principles include visualizing workflow, limiting work in progress, making policies explicit, managing flow, and making process improvements.
    - `Roles`: Kanban does not prescribe specific roles and is often used to optimize existing processes.
    - `Board`: Work items are visualized on a Kanban board, with columns representing stages of work (e.g., to-do, in progress, done).
    - `Advantages`: Flexibility, visual project tracking, focus on efficiency.
    - `Disadvantages`: Less structure, may require strong self-discipline.

4. `Waterfall Model`:

    1. The Waterfall model follows a linear, sequential approach to software development.
    2. It consists of distinct phases, such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment, with each phase dependent on the completion of the previous one.
    3. Waterfall is characterized by its upfront planning, well-defined deliverables, and limited customer involvement during development.
    4. It is often suitable for projects with stable and well-understood requirements, where change is minimal or controlled.

5. `DevOps`:

    1. DevOps is a combination of development and operations, focusing on seamless collaboration between development and IT operations teams.
    2. It aims to automate software development processes, improve deployment frequency, and enhance overall software quality.
    3. DevOps emphasizes continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and close alignment between development and operations.

6. `Which One to Choose`:

    - `Agile`: Choose Agile when you need flexibility and adaptability for projects with changing or evolving requirements. It can be tailored to various project types.
    - `Scrum`: Choose Scrum when you want a more structured and defined framework, clear roles, and specific events. It's suitable for teams with well-defined goals and requirements.
    - `Kanban`: Choose Kanban when you want to optimize existing processes and enhance workflow visibility. It's useful for teams looking to increase efficiency and minimize bottlenecks.
    - Ultimately, the choice between Agile, Scrum, and Kanban depends on your project's specific needs, team dynamics, and the level of structure and adaptability required. Some teams even combine elements from these methodologies to create a customized approach that suits their project's requirements.

### SCRUM vs AGILE

Scrum and Agile are often discussed together as they are related concepts, but it's important to note that Scrum is just one specific framework within the broader Agile approach. Here's a comparison between Scrum and Agile:

-   `Agile`: Agile is a mindset or philosophy that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. It focuses on delivering value to customers through frequent iterations and continuous feedback. The core principles of Agile, as outlined in the Agile Manifesto, include valuing individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change. Agile methodologies prioritize adaptability, customer satisfaction, and embracing change throughout the development process.
-   `Scrum`: Scrum is a specific Agile framework for managing and delivering complex projects. It provides a structured approach to software development that follows Agile principles. Scrum is characterized by its iterative and incremental development cycles called "sprints," which are time-boxed periods (typically 1-4 weeks). Scrum teams collaborate in short daily meetings called "Daily Scrums," plan and review work in "Sprint Planning" and "Sprint Review" meetings, and reflect on process improvements in "Sprint Retrospectives."

**Key Differences**:

-   Scope and Focus:

    -   Agile is a broader philosophy and mindset that can be applied to various domains beyond software development. It encompasses multiple methodologies and approaches.
    -   Scrum, on the other hand, is a specific framework within Agile that provides a defined set of roles, ceremonies, and artifacts specifically tailored for software development projects.

-   Structure and Roles:

    -   Agile does not prescribe specific roles, ceremonies, or artifacts. It allows for flexibility in adapting to the needs of the project and team.
    -   Scrum has well-defined roles, including the Scrum Master (facilitator and process enabler), Product Owner (represents the customer and prioritizes the backlog), and the Development Team (responsible for delivering the product increment).

-   Iterative Approach:

    -   Both Agile and Scrum follow an iterative approach, but Scrum employs fixed-length iterations called sprints. Each sprint produces a potentially shippable increment of the product.
    -   Agile methodologies may have different iteration lengths or may not necessarily follow fixed iterations. The focus is on delivering value through iterations and responding to customer feedback.

-   Ceremonies:

    -   Scrum has specific ceremonies, such as Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospectives, which provide structure and ensure regular communication and collaboration.
    -   Agile methodologies may have their own set of ceremonies or adapt the ceremonies based on project needs and team preferences.

-   Documentation:
    -   Agile values working software over comprehensive documentation. It emphasizes delivering functional software that meets customer needs.
    -   Scrum also emphasizes working software but includes specific artifacts like the Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Burndown Chart to support transparency and progress tracking.

<details><summary style="font-size:30px;color:Orange">Atlassian Jira</summary>

Atlassian Jira is one of the most popular tools for project management, issue tracking, and agile software development. It is highly configurable and offers a wide range of features tailored for teams across industries. Below is a comprehensive explanation of all major **terms**, **concepts**, and **components** of Jira:

1. **Projects**

    - A **project** is a collection of issues that are used to track work for a specific goal, product, or team.
    - Projects can be configured independently, with their own workflows, boards, and settings.
    - Types of projects:
        - **Team-managed projects**: Managed by individual teams with simple configurations.
        - **Company-managed projects**: Centrally managed by Jira administrators with advanced configurations.

2. **Issue**: An Issue is the fundamental unit of work in Jira. It represents any task, bug, feature, or piece of work that needs to be completed. Issues are highly flexible and can be customized based on the workflow of your team. Several types of issues are listed below:

    - `Bug`: A problem that needs fixing (e.g., "Fix login button not working").
    - `Task`: A standalone piece of work (e.g., "Update user manual for new release").
    - `Story`: A user-centric piece of work (see below).
    - `Sub-task`: A smaller task that is part of a parent issue.

    - **Custom Fields:** Jira allows customization to define additional data fields for issues, such as priority, due date, assignee, or custom labels.
    - **Workflow:** Issues move through a defined workflow (e.g., _To Do → In Progress → Done_).
    - **Example**: An issue could be as specific as: "Create an API endpoint to fetch user data."

3. **Story**: A Story in Jira represents a piece of work that delivers value to the end user. It focuses on functionality or a feature that the user needs and is often written from the user's perspective. Stories are typically small enough to be completed within a sprint (in Scrum) or a short time frame.

    - **User-Focused:** Stories are written in a format like: _"As a [user role], I want to [action/feature] so that [benefit]."_

        - `Example`: "As a customer, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account."

    - **Estimable:** Stories are broken down into manageable tasks that can be estimated in terms of effort (e.g., using story points, hours, or days).
    - **Child of an Epic:** A Story is often part of a larger body of work (Epic).
    - **Acceptance Criteria:** Stories should have clear criteria to define when they are considered complete.
    - **Story Title:** "Implement two-factor authentication"
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1. Users must enter a code sent to their email or phone.
        2. The system should log the attempt in the audit trail.

4. **Epic**: An Epic is a larger body of work that encompasses multiple Stories, Tasks, and Bugs. It represents a major initiative or objective, often spanning multiple sprints, and provides a higher-level view of the project.

    - **High-Level Goal:** Epics focus on delivering a substantial feature or solving a major problem.

        - `Example`: "Improve user account security" could include Stories like "Implement two-factor authentication" and "Update password reset flow."

    - **Cross-Team or Multi-Sprint:** Epics often require collaboration across teams and time periods.
    - **Flexible Scope:** Epics evolve over time as new Stories are added or removed based on feedback and changing priorities.
    - **Tracking Progress:** Epics are tracked on their own, often using tools like roadmaps or burndown charts.

    - **Epic Title:** "Launch a new customer portal"
    - **Related Stories:**
        1. "Design the customer portal interface."
        2. "Develop a single sign-on system."
        3. "Migrate existing customer data to the new portal."

5. **Sprints**: A **sprint** is a time-boxed iteration of work in Scrum projects, typically lasting 1-4 weeks.

    - Teams plan, execute, and deliver work during a sprint.

6. **Workflows**: A **workflow** represents the lifecycle of an issue, from creation to completion.

    - It defines statuses (e.g., Open, In Progress, Done) and transitions (e.g., Move from Open to In Progress).
    - Workflows can be customized for different projects or issue types.

7. **Boards**: Board typically includes columns that represent different stages of the workflow, from when work is planned to when it is completed. Each work item (e.g., Story, Task, or Bug) is represented by a card that moves across the board as work progresses.

    - `Scrum Board`: Focused on iterative work, used in sprints.
    - `Kanban Board`: Focused on continuous work, used to manage workflows without fixed iterations.
    - Boards are associated with projects and reflect the issues based on filters.

    - **Backlog**:

        - Represents all the work that could potentially be done in future sprints.
        - Tasks in this column are not yet ready for immediate execution.

    - **To Do** (Sprint Backlog):

        - Tasks selected during the Sprint Planning session for the current sprint.
        - Represents work that the team commits to completing in the sprint.

    - **In Progress**:

        - Tasks that are actively being worked on by team members.
        - Reflects ongoing work during the sprint.

    - **Review/Testing** (Optional):

        - Tasks that are completed but require peer review, QA testing, or stakeholder approval.
        - Ensures quality before moving tasks to the final stage.

    - **Done**:

        - Completed tasks that meet the **Definition of Done (DoD)** established by the team.
        - Work items here are ready to be delivered to the end-user or customer.

    - Work Items (Cards):

        - Each card represents a work item such as a **Story**, **Task**, **Bug**, or **Sub-task**.
        - Cards usually display:
            - Title (e.g., "Implement user login functionality").
            - Assignee (who is working on it).
            - Status (current stage in the workflow).
            - Details like priority, due date, or story points.

    - **How the Scrum Board Supports the Scrum Process**

        1. **Sprint Planning:**

            - The Scrum Board begins with the **Sprint Backlog** column populated with the work items selected during the sprint planning session.
            - These items represent the team’s commitment for the sprint.

        2. **Daily Scrum (Stand-Up):**

            - The Scrum Board acts as a reference point during the **Daily Scrum**. Team members use it to discuss:
                - What they worked on yesterday.
                - What they will work on today.
                - Any blockers or challenges.
            - Changes in task status are reflected immediately, ensuring everyone has up-to-date visibility.

        3. **Work in Progress (WIP) Limits:**

            - Teams often set **WIP limits** on the "In Progress" or "Review" columns to avoid multitasking or overburdening team members.
            - This ensures focus and smooth task flow.

        4. **Sprint Review:**

            - At the end of the sprint, completed tasks in the "Done" column are reviewed during the **Sprint Review** meeting.
            - Incomplete tasks are either returned to the backlog or carried over to the next sprint.

        5. **Retrospective Feedback:**
            - The Scrum Board provides insights for the **Sprint Retrospective**:
                - Was the sprint goal achieved?
                - Were there bottlenecks or tasks that got stuck in a particular column?
                - Did the team over-commit or under-commit?

8. **Backlog**: A backlog is a list of issues or tasks that need to be completed. It is commonly used in Scrum projects to prioritize work for upcoming sprints.
9. **Components**: Components are sub-sections of a project used to group issues. For example, in a software project, components could be Frontend, Backend, or API.
10. **Labels**: Labels are tags that can be added to issues to categorize or identify them easily.
11. **Custom Fields**: Jira allows administrators to create custom fields to capture additional information specific to their projects.

#### Relationship Between Story, Epic, and Issue

-   **Epic → Story → Sub-task:**

    -   An Epic is the overarching theme.
    -   Stories break down Epics into smaller, manageable units.
    -   Sub-tasks divide Stories into even smaller, actionable pieces.

-   **Issue as a Broad Term:**
    -   In Jira, every Epic, Story, Task, Bug, or Sub-task is technically an Issue. The term "Issue" is the generic container for all work items.

#### Example Workflow:
